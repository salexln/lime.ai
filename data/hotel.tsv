 The car park was small and unpleasant People with Mercedes and BMWs took over 2 spaces We were lucky to get a space after driving around about 10 times  The location was excellent for getting to the O2
 We weren t told that the only spa facility open was the pool and the sauna but we had already paid and had to find out ourselves when entering the spa area  The house keeping lady made my boyfriends day with how funny she was
 I asked how far the O2 was and got told a 7 minute walk no no way it was 2 trains away being on my own I was not very happy other than that it was okNo Positive
 Hot stuffy room air con not working properly Filthy windows Wallpaper ripped and worn bedside furniture tatty carpets worn and damaged bathroom door latch worn making door difficult to open from the inside Shower from another era controlled by bath taps Poor shower curtain too resulting in wet floor Carpets in corridors worn out and tatty nasty musty aroma to these areas too All in all this place is around ten years overdue a complete renovation  The bed was OK 
 Although the price seems like it is cheap you have to pay extra for everything like the swimming pool and Wifi which can fool you and sometimes comes to the same as others if not more with extras like breakfast and all  The Receptionists and Cleaners are very polite friendly and hard working staff We enjoyed our stay and would come again Rooms were clean and had enough amenities or one could request anytime without a problem
 The hotel has seen better days including the stairwell carpets which were quite threadbare The common parts are in need of decoration The quality of the towels in the bathroom was not too good and there was only one set of toiletries for two people There was an item of drug paraphernalia in the hall  My daughter and I were upgraded free of charge to an executive room with a balcony over the water We enjoyed the quality and price in the Spice restaurant and I was delighted to find porridge for breakfast in the Jenny restaurant The electric fan was a welcome addition to the room 
 Construction going on all around the hotel so many paths closed Had to pay extra to use hotel pool and spa which was a health hazard in itself Stairs leading to changing rooms and pool were filthy pool tiles didn t look like they had ever been cleaned wood was rotted in the sauna floor had food and hair on it outside The shower outside sauna had a hot and a cold button had to press both at same time in order not to scald or freeze yourself Pasta in pizzaria was microwaved Staff were incredibly rude in all areas of the hotel at one point my aunt was asked to repeat if you understand now The wifi was incredibly slow and power points or lack there of were very dated like the decor in whole hotel The only part of this review I gave more than a sad face was the location I wouldn t even give the hotel a 2  Could control the room temperature with the AC quite easily short walk to the tube station although construction closed many paths 
 Room was far too hot and air conditioning didn t work Happened on my previous stay and a staff member had to open a window with a screwdriver Unfortunately the huge vents outside were really noisy with the window open Hardly slept all night  Staff were friendly location good 
 The guy that served us was not very professional as he was telling us about other customers situation and we just wanted to get to our room The car park was so small and there was no parking at all My car was stuck between two cars all they told us he was a first come first serve Was not very happy at all  The bed was nice you could smoke in the room bouns I loved the layout of the hotel 
 The building site next door Dirty windows spoiling lovely view See photos  Room overlooking Thames good bed and room Breakfast was substantial and well prepared Location was perfect for my needs 
 Access was a little tricky due to local construction works in the area but these did not adversely impact on my journey time or cause any noise issues inside the hotel  Excellent value for money Friendly staff lots of amenities a broad range of dining options a Spa downstairs all just a stone s throw from Canary Wharf Have already recommended this to family friends for last minute work stopovers short breaks in case they need to stay in this part of London 
No Negative the location is good which is near to the train station the bedroom was big we were booking room without window but the hotel gave us a big room with window without charge 
 The staff were not at all welcoming I would go so far as to say jaded if not unhappy at obe point seen arguing with a customer in front of customers The double bed I selected wasn t a double bed at all but two single beds zipped together and very poorly and uncomfortably at that So cheap Such a bad sleep There were mice scurrying around all over the property in full view of customers from the main lobby to near the dining and bar areas to inside my room where I saw mice on two occasions during my stay The room itself had too much wear and tear with walls visibly stained marked and damaged and the toilets showing mould in the shower Totally careless I asked for a non smoking room but the room I got reeked of smoke everywhere from the curtains to the toilet So bad I want a full refund  Just the convenience 
 The lifts were badly adjusted with dangerous gaps between the leading edges og the car doors  Great location and spacious room but the whole place looks a bit tired 
 Parking was horrible The parking garage is very narrow and we drove in and out again when noticng it was full Near the entrance of the garage there were 3 members of staff walking around who did not inform anyone At least 4 other cars behind us drove in and back out again Then I walked up to ask where else we could park in the area and were told to just check out all the side streets and park there Then we drove around to find out that all parking there is for residents only After 30 minutes or so when then parked at the westferry circus garage which is a 10 minute walk away Since the garage did not mention maximum duration of parking we On the hotel itself the furnishings are a little outdated The carpets on the stairs for instance are quite worn Wifi did not work There was a card in the room with details but the network could not be found on either of the phones we had with The room itself was nice and clean Beware of the shower Water pressure is very good but the screen in front of the bath is fairly small so if you do not twist the shower head to the wall for an inch or so the whole bathroom will get wet The head is fixed to the wall and people over approx 1 85 m will not be able to stand under without squatting a little If I would have paid full price for this hotel frankly I would have been very disappointed Comparing to some 3 and 4 star hotels in London I have visited this hotel is more a 3 than a 4 star based on room comfort staff and parking  The room was perfectly fine Nothing specifically that stood out We had the luck of finding a very good deal via booking com Location is very convenient It is a 10 minute walk to Canary wharf station where you can take either underground or DLS Better even is the water bus which does not get so crowded and the air not so stifling If you are not in a rush and enjoy seeing the sights from the Thames this is one of the best ways to travel into the city 
 Every part of this stay was horrendous From start to finish When we arrived the sockets did not work so could not charge our phones before heading out for dinner The room was dirty I Woke up in the morning to the bathroom flooded water had come all the way out to the room wetting bags shoes toiletry bags etc Could not get reception on phone for ages Nobody came to clean the mess could not get hold of a GM breakfast was awful Dry toast was all we could stomach eating as place was so dirty Needless to say we are in process of looking for a full refund from the hotel  Nothing
 NOTHING We liked everything about this hotel and was so so pleased you still have smoking rooms so good as my partner didn t have to leave me to go outside for a smoke and in the morning we were able to enjoy leisurely having our first coffee relaxing as he was able to have his cigarette This was our second trip to this hotel and will definitely be back
 Bathroom could of been to a better standard but everything in the bathroom did work perfectly fine  I loved the Asian theme and the class of the hotel 
 The phone wasn t working in the room The steam room was out of action They the Sheff wasn t there to make sandwiches all day on menu there was no body there to do the massage in spa And when I mentioned my concerns to the staff and management they seemed not bothered about the issues Or to give a solution All round I think the the management and staff need to listen to the guests You can t offer these facilities without providing them  It had a car park
 Nothing it was great  We were offered a free upgrade on our room as the hotel was pretty empty Staff were friendly The views were excellent and we had a great time Barman was really great too 
 Hotel is very tired and overpriced for what it is Needs knocking down and replacing or complete renovation Beds poor with thin mattresses 2 singles pushed together to be a double etc No Positive
 The room I had could do with a bit of a spruce up especially the the en suite bathroom However it was all clean The Pizzeria in the hotel served very poor food The Indian retaurant in the hotel served deceent food  The hotel in general was absolutely fine for a 2 night stay 
 As above AC make noise if you put it on 2 so either 1 or 3 even on 3 and temp 17 5 still warm Short of staff so you have to que to check in Expensive Wifi after 30 min free Location isolated and no way 1 9 miles from O2 arena unless you go swimming so wrong info 
 WiFi is not for free which felt a bit like early 2000 s Old hotel which would require serious refurbishment Room was tidy and since the price was so low for London it was okay with me 
 The fire alarm went off and no one said anything i wasnt sure if i needed to get out or not but by the time i put my clothing back on from swimming the alarm atopped so i stayed in my room also when i went swimming noe one told me i had to sign in this is something reception shld have told me whn i checked in as i did ask her the swimming times Looked stylish waa clean but needs a little refurbisging as couls see carpets getting old bathroom corners looking mankie bath plug dont work properly be nice to have a small fridge to put our drinks in
 Staff Those of you with poker faces you should smile more you should ask a guest whether is in a need of help with luggage not just whether he she wants to pay in advance for breakfast or open an account with you or whether would prefer a more expensive room Also saying good morning and good evening to your guests once in a while is good manners Looking like a gentleman won t make you one after all it s not everything in life about money Wifi Rooms with windows at an extra charge of 20 pounds day Taxi companies you co operate with that instead of 5 mins they turn up in 35 It s not your fault entirely but most definitely not your guests  Location was good Bed was very comfortable Decent facilities
No Negative I have been staying at this hotel for 15 years Unfortunately the price is often far too high I have several August and September visits to London Your price should be less than 100 But it s far higher I like this hotel but you are pricing me out 
No Negative The bed was very comfy the view was ok work was being carried out nearby but we didnt hear it until about 9ish Very good for travelling as the canary wharf tube was a 5 min walk away 
 There was no toilet brush The bathroom was generally threadbare There was no ability to tightly close the window therefore it was very cold in the night Also guests next door were pretty loud  The window view was wonderful I like the hotel interior design 
 Hotel and staff a little sad need a bit of updating sprucing up Lovely to have a pool but the whole area was not very clean and needs more than a lick of paint  Great location is it s redeeming feature
 The rooms did not look like the ones on the picture I had to change rooms because the first one was not what I expected Booked two single beds however the beds were only one armlength apart The closet door was broken Whn I asked the receptionist about the room on the pictures displayed on booking com I was told that those rooms do not exist Staff was friendly enough to over us a different room which was okay The furnishing was really outdated I was shocked that this is supposed to be a four star hotel There was no air conditioning in the room While it was only 15 C outside the roomtemperature was around 28 5 C Turning on the air ventilation was in vain and also incredibly loud  Close to Canary Wharf You will find a lot of shopping malls Close to the DLR and Underground Staff was very friendly I guess the price is rather cheap considering the location and the surrouding area 
 The angle of the TV was a bit annoying it was postioned facing away from the bed which I thought to be very strange The bathroom floor was quite slippy I nearly slipped and died The room was so hot too The air con just didn t do it any justice We couldn t feel it at all Due to the old fashioned theme of the hotel I believe they could probably upgrade the air con and possibly modernise it a bit more The armchairs though comfortable did have a huge rip down the back of it which I thought was a bit crude considering the location and the amount of visitors they must have  The room was very spacious the window across the room made it light and airy and it was very welcoming The bathroom was very modern and there were mirrors everywhere making it even more spacious The bed was comfy the armchairs also The room was clean and well maintained The location of the hotel was fabulous and great value for money considering it is in the area of canary wharf The room was also cosy and old fashioned which considering the exterior made it feel homely inside The receptionist due to a fault with my booking upgraded me to a bigger room which I thought was very nice of her and she was very friendly even though I wasn t in the best of moods The room also had a great dressing room table with loads of space and a great mirror to make myself look half decent which was fab 
 Rooms on the first floor do not have air conditioning Our rooms were unbearably hot Breakfast was poor  Good location a short walk from the shops restaurant and public transport of canary wharf 
 Walking access from the train station was convoluted because of building works  The room was spacious and comfortable the staff were helpful in finding a room for us as ours wasn t ready We only stayed one night and left early next day so didn t use any of the facilities 
 The build is not a new infraestructure the room was old fashion  Big hotel with a lot of facilities in a good location in order to visit London in a few days
 There was no water in the complimentry tray with tea and coffee There is NO fridge Carpet are old and smelly WiFi not available in rooms No free parking No Positive
 At breakfast not shown to table or offered tea or coffee Tables filthy standard of food appalling had a few mouthfuls and left Check out only one person checking guests out as another left to work in back office Not asked about my stay and not interested in me as a customer or future business Does not compare to the Hilton Group  Room cleanliness good
 Hotel very tired don t see how it can be classed as 4star room ver hot no airconditon no windows in some rooms Convince to transport and restaurant
 Staff achieved the bare minimum of helpfulness but no desire to add value or go the extra mile Room was mostly clean but glasses in bathroom and and other objects were dusty  Location aesthetic 
 Bathroom was old dirty and dated The basin did not work and the shower which was incorporated in the bath did not work well The breakfast was awful the coffee tasted bad the bacon smelt off there was little choice no continental option or very little the food looked unappealing and stale The cutlery plates and cups were dirty and felt greasy I tried to eat but felt distgusted and bought breakfast outside the hotel  Location
 We couldn t stay all night as parking was full and there wasn t any parking nearby A quick call to reception for advise was unhelpful as they advised it was unsafe to park anywhere else The hotel parking on its own did not seem too secure either There is no access from the parking levels straight into the hotel pedestrians have to walk up and down the same way as cars go which is risky and a tad inconvenient too  To be frank nothing wowed me about the hotel The entrance is good but you enter via filthy doors and a very busy and unwelcoming reception 
 Beds not comfy tried to charge us 20 night to upgrade to a room with windows when we had a room with windows anyway Booked a double room and given a twin room with 2beds pushed together complained changed room to a double Rooms very dated and old No Positive
 Cumbersome check in process poor wifi connectivity quality of breakfast should be better it should have a separate breakfast room or serving point for large groups of travelling children  Location Fitness facilities
 Breakfast was rubbish with the restaurant more like a canteen in Butlins  Not a lot to be honest It was just an average hotel in London and I would not stay there again 
 The room was shabby with worn carpet and furniture The bed was uncomfortable The breakfast was disorganised and not of a quality that would be expected of a large city hotel Wifi was not really usable due to 20min per day Having to pay extra for hotel facilities eg pool  The public areas of the hotel were ok The room was quiet 
 Extremely disappointing No free Internet in room and you have to pay for every device you want connected once per day The breakfast buffet was not good For example the yogurt had the consistency of water The room itself had cracked yellow water stained drywall or plaster ceiling Sink didn t drain A C somewhat worked but the vent was almost plugged with dust They staff was definitely not very friendly but did their job adequately You ll survive a stay here but you aren t likely to particularly enjoy it I ve stayed at many roadside motels over the years that were cleaner nicer and a way way better value This is not a 4 star hotel experience If you arrive with the mindset that it s a place to sleep and won t be eating there won t need Internet won t spend any time in your room and don t sweat small stuff like a sink that won t drain it will be okay Otherwise probably try somewhere else  It was relatively affordable but NOT worth the price There was nothing that I can think of that we liked about the property 
 It was very old fashioned and tired looking in many areas Would definitely benifit from a refit The shower in our room was very basic and sprayed all over the place which was very annoying while trying to get ready The plug socket nearest to the bed was an original fitting and so couldn t actually be used with a modern plug Very basic overall rough around the edges  Location was very good Easy to find and very close to the tube station We booked a room without a window but to our surprise on arrival the room we were allocated had a large window with a pleasant view of the river and london landmarks The late night in house pizzeria came in handy 
 The rooms aircon was noisy and not very effective The view was a aircon unit upon a roof and the whole experience made me feel I was back in the 80 s We stopped there as I was attending a conference at The Excell Centre and when I typed in hotels close to the Docklands it bought this one up It was close to the other side of the Docklands which then still cost us 15 in a cab to reach Shame as booking com have let themselves down with this hotel No Positive
 Unfortunately the rooms are a bit dated and the carpet could have been cleaner as there were stains on it  The room was very spacious and the buffet breakfast was good with plenty of choices to choose from a light breakfast to the full English It s also a good location as you are only about 15mins into the City of London and about 10mns from Greenwich where I was visiting I didn t have much interaction with the staff but when I checked in the girl was very nice and helpful It was good value for money 
 Hotel staff was not cooperating at all Beds were separated Spring Mattress were paining in back like hell Bathroom sinks were choked Had to brush in Bath tubs Cleaning staff was pathetic Swimming pool was chargeable Internet wi fi was free for a whole 20 minute session in whole day and that too in hotel lobby and not in room Overall the property was not value for money at all and staying there was a nightmare No Positive
 The room had no air conditioning and the windows don t open and the heat was well in the 20c all night building work a few yards off the building so the windows are dirty staff very good  Room clean location first class breakfast good for the price
 No air conditioning in rooms When paying over 100 a night you would expect air con However the room did have a little fan to help blow the hot air around the room Also I left some expensive items in the bathroom but when I called the next day the receptionist informed me nothing was handed in Can t say surprised but very disappointed  Tube not ridiculously far away
 wifi was a bit complicated you are allowed to use free wifi 2 times for 20 min in a day in the room if you want all day hotel requests extra money but in the lobby area it was free so people were sitting in the lobby area on the evenings  we have booked a non window room due to cheap price but while check in hotel offered a new room with window and no price difference room has almost everything that you may require no noise at nigths so had good sleeps during 3 days although hotel is not placed in zone1 there are 2 metro lines in 5 min walking distance so we had no transport problem 
 Wifi not free after 30 mins really considering it s 2017 Electric sockets near bed side were unusable as they were 3 pin again It s 2017 the rooms need to facilitate modern technology use and ease of access Food price good but bland bland bland Poor mass produced deserts Staff helpful Concierge excellent Reception staff male needs to understand the art of good customer service and interaction as at times came across as dismissive 
 Overpriced No good value for money  The blonde girl at reception was very kind This was when we checked in at 10 30pm on the 7th Except that nothing else 
 Nothing There was no water available for drinking to even buy Had to go to the local Tesco Very inconvenient Checking in was a night mare Very bad experience 
 She room upstairs are a bit dated and the lefts take forever to come had to use the stairs at one point  I like the space of the room the bath tab and that the water was nice and hot I stayed for a few days the cleaner was so helpful she made sure I had everything I needed 
 The staffs who were there in the morning don t use words called thank you and sorry We couldn t have breakfast because there was a very long queue When we requested for a refund for the breakfast the lady at the check out counter gave us a rude look and said non refundable A polite word would do the magic The food at the Indian restaurant was not up to the mark  The beds are comfy and the room was clean 
 The hotel was a bit far from the sight seeing and tourist activities that we had planned The walk to the underground was a bit far also Spent a lot of time traveling to and from London Center Also the construction made finding the entrance difficult and it was a bit noisy  The accommodations were clean and adequate The lobby area was a great place to relax and meet people The restaurant had great food and I liked the extended hours The concierge was extremely helpful in giving us useful tips about making the best use of our time in London 
 The facilities and decoration are so old  The location wise is okay but it is next to a construction site and very dusty when I walk out of the hotel 
 The queue for the breakfast was very long and not worth waiting in Very expensive for what the hotel offered and there is nothing around the hotel at all The tube station is around a 5 10min walk  Staff were friendly
 There was a strange sound through the whole of the night and called the manager to try and fix the problem Next day he said the problem was fixed after he sent a maintenance team The second night of course the sound was there It was a sound which resembled a phone vibrating which come from the ceiling bathroom For the 4 star rating is not acceptable Another issue there was not any fridge in the room  Very classic classy decoration with nice views 
 The bed was like sleeping on a chain link fence and the neighbors and hallway were noisy  The decor was reminiscent of visiting my grandparent s home 
 I know I booked a budget room but I didn t realize rooms without windows even existed anymore but that s what I got Nor did it have air conditioning Just a fan The daytime temperatures were about 30 degrees so I had two uncomfortable nights Had I known all this in advance I probably would have paid more for something better or an Airbnb I actually dreamed about being on holiday in North Korea It was that good My other gripe was the length of time it took to get a beer Short queues at the bar took forever to get to the front of mainly because people were buying huge rounds of drinks The bar girl did her best but the odds were stacked against her More bar staff might be an idea Plenty of people without my determination and unquenchable thirst gave up and I don t blame them My third and final gripe is the external camouflage of the hotel which is labelled the P Hotel outside with no obvious clue as to its claimed name of Britannia International For a non London dweller like me simple things like this matter quite a lot when I am hot and tired and lost  A decent if traditional breakfast and several reasonably priced restaurants in the hotel The staff were also really friendly and helpful especially when the number signs leading to my room led me into a stairwell really 
 No mention of an extra charge for leisure facilities online or when checked in Had to go up to the room again to get cash When queried this at reception the lady was unhelful unfriendly and unapologetic One manager was very friendly and helpful however other staff did not smile or make conversation Leisure facilities were very poor The rest of the hotel was clean and tidy Leisure area carpet was filthy dirty rubbish bag on the floor carpet looked like it had not been hoovered Sauna was cold pool was cold pool area was outdated including walls peeling generally run down Dirty flannel at side of hot tub  View over the dock was lovely and bar breakfast area Also the room was clean and spacious 
 The rooms need a bit of a facelift The double bed is made up of two singles stuck together New carpet is needed  The location and the size of the room Apart from the construction going on in the surrounding areas the views were very nice 
 My experience with this hotel was quite bad as follows When we had arrived we were not greeted at the entrance by any concierge or bellboy and left to us to take our luggage into the hotel ourselves but once we got to the front desk I began speaking to one of the staff and was rudely interrupted by another most likely more senior staff who insisted on assisting with my check in Once all of the particulars were given it was time to speak about the payment even though I had already made the booking and payment through booking com What annoyed me tremendously is the way in which I was spoken to it seems many hotels in London have staff with attitude problems where they speak to guests as if they cannot afford the stay so to speak Quite infuriating and pretty much set the precedent for the rest of the stay The bed was ridiculously small for 2 people if you make a half turn from the centre of the bed you are already at the edge of the bed Good luck if you toss and turn during sleep don t be surprised to find yourself waking up on the floor The room looked tired and unattractive the carpets were frayed inside the room and in the corridor and all of the furniture in the room was worn and tired I approached the front desk requesting assistance in organising a chauffeured ride to Heathrow Airport and instead of assisting me the front desk staff just told me to speak to the concierge Nothing wrong with that but the problem in this case was that there was no human being at the concierge desk which was right across on the right hand side of the staff member All she had to do was look to the right and she would have seen there was no one there In any case I walked across waiting 10 minutes for someone to come but no one appeared which was quite disturbing I just gave up in the end and used an online booking service instead  The location was great just across the road from the monorail station which brought us to the city centre within 15 to 20 minutes Absolutely tremendous There was a really nice view from my room we were quite high up so we could see the entire city from our angle Just across the road and down the street a little there was a small Tesco supermarket which was great to purchase some late night snacks and fruit juices The bathroom was quite a good size there was room to move and shower The room temperature was good you just needed a little patience for it to get going after setting the desired temperature A great aspect of this hotel is the breakfast and dinner areas The breakfast was really great had everything you can want for a Western breakfast buffet all of the food was cooked very well and the serving area was always kept clean and tidy Dinner was superb very nice tasting cuisine and lovely staff to help if required It was a real pleasure to eat at this hotel it s one thing they ve done exceptionally well at a reasonable price for London 
No Negative Liked the area but lots of building works going on all around Ideal location for City Airport and O2 Hotel a bit outdated and in need of refurb but good value for money for London Would certainly use it again
 The coffee was undrinkable The air con was pathetic When 2 coach loads of new guests all arrived together it took 3 4 of an hour to be able to use the lifts No Positive
 Hotel a little tired needs a refurb and surrounded by a building g site at the moment Good location as close to tube station great place for short stay local restaurants and bars within easy walking distance
 The staff at reception should have greeted us with a smile They did get more smiley after my partner made a joke or two but it had to be prompted  Beds very comfy We got the room on a deal and so we were very happy with the value for London The Canary Wharf area is a great place to stay and filled with shops and restaurants We would stay here again 
 Paid for wifi in 2017 Really Even the free 20 minutes wouldn t let me VPN or tunnel traffic to access remote systems for my work just basic browsing possible I travel to Canary Wharf for business most weeks this one problem puts Britannia at the bottom of the accommodation options for me The windows were dirty outside so the advantage of a good viewpoint was negated Windows wouldn t open aircon not up to the job min temp max fan and the room was still too warm it would have been fine if a window was able to be opened Furnishings decor were functionally fine but a little dated and shabby  Reception staff were very efficient and professional I was informed that the room was upgraded from the one I booked at no additional cost The room was a good size and there was fancy bath I didn t use it but a nice extra The room bedding towels etc were all perfectly clean and tidy and presented well 
 Uncomfortable bed pillow Windows didn t open and air con was very poor Shower flooded entire bathroom and fell off wall continually when spoke to reception rude stated it s hand held only didn t say that in their description of facilities Breakfast was horrible and general cleanliness in dining room poor To be honest would not return not much to like about this hotel other than it is handy for the O2 arena
 Staff response to friend being locked int he toilet as a disappointing they found it very amusing and did nothing to reassure the person trapped No apology was provided nor anything done to temporarily fix the issue which had happened before  Location to O2 was great 1 stop on the tube and a short walk to the hotel 
 The service at check in was poor There were four staff but only one was dealing with customers waiting to check in There was no safe or fridge in the room Use of in room internet was 7 00 and use of security boxes was chargeable as well Poor selection of tea and coffee options in the room no decaffeinated alternatives  We liked the location
 Use of pool and gym had to be paid for That was a bit disappionting Building need a bit of maintenance  Staff was friendly Canary Wharf is a good area to stay Easy access to the center 
 Due to all the building works locally getting to the hotel wasn t easy not helped by reception staff giving you the wrong information about the quickest route which was closed Waited 15mins for bar staff to serve me and then gave up  It was cheap for mid week in central London
 The room was surprisingly spacious and the theme was jovial it felt like an escape It was a brilliant location and tube links to other parts of London made it easy to reach our play on time The cocktails were good We got in late from our play and there was good food available but could have been better  Good hotel all round for the price we had Staff were very helpful 
 The hotel was quite impersonal The view from the window was a little off putting It looked straight out onto the river It was like being on board ship or staying in Venice  The room was clean and fairly close to the tube The breakfast was good 
 Absence of safe box in a room No fridge Wifi is free for only 20 minutes a day Fungus in bathroom room 933 Air conditioning was poor  Location Near business centers 
 The whole hotel is very tired old fashioned and over furnished The air con only put out 30 degree heat so it was really difficult to get the room cool The view was good but there is a building going up right next door so that view of the water isn t going to last long There is a reason why its cheap in the area but if its value for location rather than pretty surroundings you re looking for this is it  This hotel is excellently located and the staff were efficient The room was also clean 
 The breakfast was disorganised chaos a lot of food was under cooked or not available our table was cleared whilst we waited for food on the first day Our table was used as a dumping ground for pots by a waitress who was clearing another table and when we complained to one of the waitresses it was met by a shrug of the shoulders and raised hands to indicate what could she do about it No Positive
 No hot water Stayed 3 nights and only managed 1hot shower Breakfast was hit and missed first two mornings was fine but it was cold on the 3rd morning but also crazy busy too  The hotel staff were excellent and couldn t do enough for us had a evening meal at there and was excellent
 Room wifi should be provided for free And TV screen was small for the room  The room interior decoration was nice and was of more traditional and feeling royal 
 Could do with a spruce up a lot of building work going on Good location as a Base Quite difficult to locate at first Sat navs do not like this area Walking distance to shops pubs and restaurants Loads of taxis available not far from the river
 Staff extremely rude and unhelpful at check in and when I asked to speak to the Hotel manager the next morning he must have attended the same charm school as his staff as his attitude was just as dismissive  Good breakfast
 Just a little tired had to ask for bath towels which were then supplied promptly and could not get a nightcap Baileys when returning around midnight Main bars closed Pizza place only served beer and wine  Location good
 Got what I thought was a special offer price that seemed more like a price for substandard experience Hard to find the room corridors like a Warren with paper signs that were worn and grubby No porter and a dismissive point from the concierge to get a trolley ourselves Once maneuvered onto correct floor had to get two very heavy cases and two smaller up 6 stairs then get them through the maze of corridors that were semi blocked with maids trolleys The hotel felt more like a hostel with crowds of youngsters congregating in the lobby for coaches then in the evening slouched over the sofas some asleep Every morning we were woken early by loud shouting down the corridors from what appeared to possibly be construction workers Most awful hotel experience I ve ever had which constrasted greatly with that when this hotel first opened Staff were also unwelcoming Would never stay there again  Good location for my needs 
 Nothing  Reall nice hotel Ideally suited for the stations The rooms although looking a bit tired were clean and quite big The staff were all very pleasant and helpful We would without a doubt visit this hotel again We ate in the r lunch with our son and daughter in law and the food was good and very reasonably priced 
 We had a double bed that was hard and had no valance that made it look rather tatty The wash hand basin tap in the bathroom didn t work which we complained about immediately but was never repaired We were initially given a room on the second floor that looked out over a flat roof complete with full black plastic bags We complained and were then given a room on the 8th floor that was much better  The breakfast was good value for money with a reasonable choice and well cooked with the bacon being particularly good Reasonably convenient for both the jubilee line and DLR though it was a bit of a walk with cases Public areas were well kept but overall the hotel is in need of refurbishment work in most areas 
 The hotel needs refurbishment as it looks very tired My partner and I had a room with stains on the carpet and cob webs in the window  The location was superb for visiting the city especcially the O2
 Room didn t have a window which we were aware of but there was no air con Very hot small room Expected a bit more for the amount we paid Hotel was tired needs a bit of TLC WOULDN T STAY AGAIN No Positive
 No free wifi and everything was 1000 yrs old and tired even the staff but i felt sorry for them cos it wasnt their fault  The menu was limited but the food was generous and cooked well 
 For the money 350 it was an awful place tired needs redecorating not even biscuits in the room or a shower gown and slippers Absolutely appalling  there was a 20 minute wait So no breakfast 
 AC was bit noisy but worked well There s a 20 min complimentary wifi available in the lobby and I was able to connect to that from my fourth floor room as well but if you need a faster connection for work and 24 7 use it costs seven pounds per day In these times when free fast wifi is everywhere I would highly recommend the hotel management to consider wifi revamp  I had booked a single room which comes without window but receptionist informed me he had upgraded me to a bigger room with window as the room type I had booked was unbearably hot Highly appreciated as the city was under heatwave Though the room was bit on the scruffy side tapestry and furniture worn out it was clean and had all basic amenities coffee tea making stuff hairdryer iron ironing board etc Safety boxes are not available in the rooms but at reception 
 Some of the reception team spoke little English and you had to write a note for them to pass on No decaff coffee sachets available for the room Good location Sizable and comfortable room with the surprise of a Jacuzzi Good size restaurant for breakfast with plenty of choice 
 There can t still be many hotels that still charge for Wi Fi in the room Just tethered my phone but I still find it annoying and a disincentive to book again Also is it usual to charge residents for use of the gym Don t book breakfast at time or reservation or charge breakfast to room Book breakfast when you check in for 30 cheaper for what is otherwise a rather expensive but average buffet breakfast weird but useful to know  Right in the middle of Docklands
 the internet wifi not good at all its not free the room was so hot no air condition at all also the windows not open view was bad the room was not sea viewNo Positive
 The bed was too hard very noisy as there was construction work next to the hotel which was also our view  The family room was very spacious clean and staff were friendly The spa facilities for 4pound a day was very good value sauna steam jacuzzi and swimming Walking distance to Canary Wharf and to the DLR 
 Think the beds could be comfier If we weren t so tired from all the walking during the day think it would have been a bit of struggle to get a good nights sleep But then again if it had a refurb the price would go up  It was a great location only a short walk to the tube or DLR Plenty of places to eat or stop for a coffee around 
 Reception staff were unfriendly one was extremely un cooperative about check out procedures Room was shabby and the tea coffee provision was very poor Toiletries also poor Overpriced for what was provided and has definitely gone downhill since I first stayed there several years ago  I like the spacious foyer and found the Concierge very pleasant and helpful about keeping luggage 
 The room was quite large could have done with a small fridge The bath towels were a little too thin in texture I would have expected them to be a bit larger than they were The mattress was a little too hard for our liking  We were greeted upon arrival by friendly welcoming staff We were upgraded at no extra charge to a suite when we checked in There were coffee tea making facilities a hairdryer iron Nice toiletries provided in the bathroom 
 I arrived around 11pm and the reception staff were being helpful sorting out people whose rooms didn t have aircon and a group with a billing question but it meant I had to wait 45 minutes to check in There were other staff in the office who I felt should have noticed there was a queue and come out to help Both single beds in the room were very basic narrow beds which looked and felt rather temporary the bed was comfortable enough but it seemed a bit cheeky for the price That plus getting only 20 minutes free wifi made it feel slightly over priced  Large room plenty of hanging space good soundproofing and good aircon I stayed in the middle of a heatwave Short walk from South Quay station on the DLR 
 The air con in our room was broken on the hottest day of the year we were unable to open the windows fans were provided but they only succeeded in pushing hot air around The extractor fan in the bathroom didn t work at all and we ended up sleeping with the door open as the air con was working in the corridors I don t think we would stay again The Location of the hotel was great easy access to the underground lots of bars and eateries nearby The breakfast was good there was quite a lot of choice and the view over the water while eating a cooked brekkie was great 
 When I booked my confirmation screen said wifi parking and swimming pool were included but when I arrived reception told me I would need to pay an extra 4 per day to use the pool and gym Also the wifi is only free in the lobby so the way this location is advertised on Booking com is really deceiving and unfair  Facilities are ok and the swimming pool is nice but you have to pay extra to use them 
 Staff attitude Hot room Air conditioning not working long story but we asked 5 times and nothing was done even though they said it would Shower broken Furniture old and tatty Tea making facilities minimal Many other problems  Not a lot
 That insodemt put a damper on the hole holiday I love London but was disgusted with the way I was spoken to by the camber maid she told me I was not write in the head in front of my daughter how has learning defceltus disgusting
 AC per room The room did not have air conditioning it only had a small desk fan which was not enough to ventilate the room The room was a bit stuffy other than that the room was clean 
 The staff s attitude and the hot room The room was very hot No air conditioning The staff moved us twice but we had to beg to be moved Very unhelpful 
 Would have been better if you didn t have to pay 7 for wifi per device per room that is far too expensive Room was lovely and bed was comfy bathroom Was clean and nice
 I booked the room through booking com but when we arrived the lady at the front desk said for the price I paid on this site we d have a room with no windows They offered an upgrade to a superior double room with king size bed on the top floor for 30 The only truth in the upgrade was the top floor bit The bed was smaller than a standard double there were flies in the room and was not superior to anything I spoke to the manager about the problems and he offered a room change we d already unpacked and got as settled as we could so all I wanted was the upgrade money back That didn t happen The breakfast the next morning was not worth the 10 each The bacon was like cardboard the eggs didn t taste right and the whole breakfast was a huge let down So the price started on here as 73 I ended up paying 150 which included 24hr parking the upgrade and breakfast for 2 Not impressed with any of it a Premier Inn would have been the better option  The main entrance is very grand and the hand rails are polished daily so are very shiny 
 Old style My room was a Den I had to pay 20 to upgrade Wif fi is chargeable and the staff at check in was not helpful i asked the lady 3 times to explain to me what I had access to etc she kept showing directions lol Great location needs revamp but some may like that style  Location
 Everything needs to be paid additional breakfast spa facilities and everything  Perfect price with 75 discount and costed only 59 The next day sameroom was 250 great location great spa
 Single bed was quite narrow and the room has seen its best days chips and detrition here and there Noisy AC  Receptionist kindly upgraded me at room with window as according to him the room type I ve had booked was unbearably hot there was a heat wave during my stay This is honesty and customer service as its best 
 If you wanted to use the pool you had to pay extra That was a bit much considered I paid over 100 for one night Would not go again based on that Room was good size and there was a Tesco close by
 The Bar seemed to close very early on the Saturday night which was a bit of a pity we were given 10 minuted to get our last orders in and when I got up 2 minutes late to order our drinks we were told the time was up and the barman closed a rail in my face We then spoke to the Barman who agreed to serve us our last drinks as there were a few people also in our predicament However it did put a sour taste in our mouths as it was our first night there and the following night we went to another pub instead  We booked a room without a window but we were put in a lovely room with a window so we were delighted about that The fact the view showed over some construction didn t deter us as we were not expecting any view at all The room we were given was also larger than we were supposed to have gotten so that was an extra perk and especially because the price made it extra value The staff were lovely and welcoming on check in and it was just a pity that the staff in the bar were not as welcoming The view sitting the Bar was really lovely as it sat right out onto the waterside which was really nice in either the morning or evening time to sit and relax 
 Friendly staff quiet location beautiful hotel relaxing and welcoming with a fantastic range of cuisine from the restaurant  Convenient location for excel exhibition centre situated on Canary Wharf 
 1 Coffee at breakfast was simply vile Large flasks of stewed tepid bitter coffee Yuk 2 The whole place is at best tired and old fashioned at worst grubby dusty dilapidated 3 The entire surroundings are construction sites with high rise concrete buildings springing up This meant that the most convenient route to the hotel from the tube or DLR are all blocked requiring a detour Also work on the nearest site 20 yards from our bedroom window began at 7 30 drilling clanging of scaffolding yelling etc We would have expected to be told about this at the time of booking  Good breakfast choice and quality was good 
 Everything was bad wifi wasnt working charging port wasn t near bed Reception was trying to tell me to upgrade my room Food was pathetic and the attitude if staff was also bad and disrespectful For room service it was additional 5 pounds Probably the worst hotel i have ever stayed in Not recommend at allNo Positive
 The room itself was so old fashioned they are in definate need of a total revamp curtains carpets etc bathroom taps were full of limescale parts missing shortage of electrical sockets I m glad I was only there for one night No Positive
 N A Excellent service every thing was lovely Front desk Reception Lady GERDA was smiling and pleasant very quick check in that s what any customer feels happy with good protocol bar staff was brilliant i requested ice bucket with ice straight away got it Over all it was Excellent stay i will stay again 
 Filthy exterior Windows hadn t been cleaned for years Ceiling mirror tiles near reception had similarly not been cleaned for years In our room the carpet was rotting near the edges The furniture was well worn as was the general decoration The power sockets were a strange mixture of modern uk 3pin and 3pins with large round Earth at the top TV was old so no subtitle facility The shower could be set to either scalding hot or freezing cold but nothing in between The beds themselves were of only poor quality  My worst hotel experience for many years After seeing the imposing hotel frontage and checking in with friendly desk staff it was all down hill from there on apart from the staff who cleaned the rooms Unfortunately the level of investment in the hotel was so low as to almost negate their best efforts 
 No wash cloths staff didn t even understand what they were Room had no A C but they offered to open the windows Moved us to a room supposedly with A C but it was a smoking room windows kept opening so dirt dust as well as residual smell from smoking made room unbearable Furnishings were all nicked up carpet dirty sofa stained and hot water control on shower so sensitive you either had cold or scalding water  Nothing 
 The room was unclean I booked a double room but was apparently upgraded to a suite which had 2 single beds pushed together The room temperature would not drop below 26 degrees no water in the room which I find in this day and age and at the cost we paid was unacceptable the room was in need of a refurbishment the shower was either red hot or freezing cold The windows in the downstairs bar were absolutely filthy the air con also didn t work anywhere on the ground floor The furniture in the downstairs bar and foyer area need replacing as it had pieces of tape holding splits in the leather together The staff behind reception were grumpy and were not helpful at all the staff in breakfast were all young children and were lacking leadership and needed to be motivated there were many tables uncleaned with the previous persons plates still sat there the presentation of the food looked rushed and was chucked in dishes to try and keep up with the masses of people queuing to get into breakfast I actually went in for breakfast early prior to going for a meeting and was waiting so long I had to leave as I would have been late for my meeting The staff in the bar were actually very nice and did there best for us  The room was big
 the bar staff didnt seem to care at all that we were waiting and just stood talking amongst theirselves We arrived on a day where the temp was close to 30 degrees entered our room to find no air con and no windows the bed was very uncomfortable and pillows likewise liked the location and the reception staff were friendly and helpful
 My son s room was a poky little corner room with now windows no air single bed and no room to swing a cat The rooms were old and furniture was very poor quality Our bed had an old wooden frame The check in took ages It cost 155 per room The breakfast was very poor quality greasy food and little selection When we tried to speak to someone about the rooms and other complaints we were fobbed off by saying we needed to complete an online form We won t be staying again Premier Inns and Travelodge are much better quality in service and in decor beds and furniture  Nothing much
 This is the first time booking com have let me down This is not worth the money I paid 290 for a standard room for 1 night is a joke when the next night was on offer for 67 and then up to 147 the next day just because a concert was on awful hotel dirty smelly fusty room aircon broke 32degrees outside windows in breakfast finger prints all over staff at breakfast very rude i arrived at 9 50am and half the place was closed off nobody to greet me show me where to sit couldnt find table with cutlery or cups got hot breakfast sat it at table to get toast and fruit time i got to fruit area was 10 01am gone Taken away staff hovered over waiting on my plate to whisk it away complained at reception to no avail No Positive
 No biscuits with the tea coffee But that wasn t a serious gripe  I was happy to be upgraded for free to double room with a window as I had originally booked a room without a window in an attempt to minimise costs The room was very spacious and the bed very comfortable As I had an exam the next day I was glad to have had a good night s sleep 
 This was a very warm time of the year for England and the air conditioning in the room did not work I had to complain to get a better room with working air conditioning I don t think they should charge for the use of the fitness center or the pool  Our stay was better after the first night see comments about the air conditioning They served a good English breakfast a great start to any day The staff were responsive to our requests 
 I did not like being charged for the same room twice and not being able to get a refund of either the hotel or booking com Both blaming the other party  Not a great deal 
 The bed was very uncomfortable The leisure facilities could do with an upgrade or at least a good clean The door to the sauna was broken and there were dangerous loose floor tiles Charging 4 for residents to use these facilities and 1 non refundable for the towels  Spice The Indian Restaurant The comfortable lounge sofa s and the view from the lounge 
 Inside the hotel is shabby dirty and old There was a cockroach in the Italian restaurant which the staff laughed about and there was a mouse in the bar later that evening Terrible Never seen such things in a London 3 4star hotel  Good location Looks good from the entrance 
 the car park was charged at 21 and it isn t even their car park they won t call u a cab u have to go out on the roadside and hale one my wife is in a wheelchair they were rude and disrespectful towards her nothing
 The main issue of the hotel has been temperature When I arrived there were 34C degrees in the room not a good start After one hour of maximum AC still 34 degrees Management offered a fan but that didn t help and the night turned into a nightmare Windows can not be opened It is not acceptable to let guests sleep in a room with 34C degrees The next night I had to keep the door open for a couple of hours to get the temperature to drop a little It was not a problem of my room as I talked to other guests and they were all experiencing the same Breakfast quite basic and this would be OK but a small buffet at the end of a stretched room meant a long queue to just get some fruits In a nutshell don t get this hotel in summer especially if you re traveling for business Not a good idea to have a business meeting after a restless night soaked  I liked the britannic style of the hotel old england fashion comfortable lounge couches Rooms are spacious there is tea and coffee in the room iron and ironing board no minibar 
 Our room had no window just a mural It was so hot in there and there was one vent fan whirring all night above us that was very noisy was booked into room 137 so avoid that one Didn t sleep much at all There was also something taped off that looked like a vent on the ceiling that didn t look very nice  The location was excellent and easy to find
 Quite pricey considering there was no window or breakfast included The room had air con but we couldn t adjust it and with no window the room was far too hot  Good location comfortable room and bed
 1st room was small dirty walls paint peeling and windows that didn t open We got moved after complaining to an alternative room Junior suite this was a smoking room neither of us smoke but limited availability The whole hotel is dark and very tired with threadbare carpets A lot of money for a poor hotel  Breakfast was good
 That whilst checking in the 3 members of staff didn t even acknowledge the queue that was forming I was offered a free up grade to a room where the curtains had to stay closed due to the work outside and the heat was unbearable the room was immaculately clean and the bathroom was spotless
 It was absolute waste of money really dirty room dirty bathroom Air con was not working when I complained about it they replied Sir it is too warm today so thats why its not working but we can give you a fan if you want one and regarding dirty room reply was we will try to clean it later  Nothing good about this hotel at all 
 The room is quite small and without a window Frankly with the whole day spent in meetings that feature was not missed The corridors are quite winding and the Fire Exit signs are not clear That can be a safety hazard  The location is quite convenient with a DLR station just a couple of minutes away Very easy to get to the City There are restaurants on site as well as many in close proximity at Canary Wharf The bathroom was surprisingly big compared to the size of the room
 TV didn t work and no plugs near kettle Rooms with no windows are too hot artificial airflow needed  Easily accessible via DLR Well presented good first impression Staff welcoming and helpful 
 didn t like anything the rooms were small and not worth for the amount paid the WIFI was not provided across the rooms which was huge drawback for the business trips Buying Dinner Vouchers and not reaching in time is waste of money so i advice to choose outside the hotel rather having at the premises  the breakfast was good and nothing else 
No Negative In house Italian restaurant OK on price food comes with a home cooked feel and plenty of veg salad which some might find unsophisticated but I really like 
 Old school furniture and decoration The room was quite dark Breakfast was always very crowdy and noisy the food not really tasty Very touristic hotel and impersonal  Probably one of the cheapest hotel in the area Well located 
 The rooms was dreadful too hot and stuffy crammed with dreadful furniture that was ruined and a filthy stained carpet The late staff serving a very limited chips or garlic bread was so rude we were shocked  Nothing 
 Old dated Stains on wall Small flimsy towels Very basic considering supposed to be 4 star Breakfast below par Scrambled egg was green bacon grisly coffee cold Been to better travellodges No Positive
 having to book online AT the hotel Couldn t understand why they could not have simply taken the booking direct And having to pay 21 for overnight parking underneath the hotel friendly staff
 Stayed in a suite on the top floor Needed a thorough redecoration peeling wallpaper a crude drawing scratched onto the settee along with names scratched into the headboard and the bathroom in desperate need of change The shower simply shut down half way through my shower and made a sound like the QE2 docking The bathroom shook The jet bath was stained brown and dripping only one visible plug you could either watch TV or make a drink not great I stayed in the Hilton last time and would stay there in the future  Great location Friendly staff and a good breakfast 
 Definitely needs refurbishment Would have been lovely in its day but now very tired looking although clean Short walk to bars and restaurants Good transport links
 Needs a little updating Our room was upgraded free of charge and it was amazing Lovely hot tub bath room was huge Lovely big windows and the view was beautiful 
 It s a little bit out of the way Traveling to and from the hotel each day was at least half an hour each way for most London tourist attractions  Reasonable value for money in London
 Had to wait 30 minutes to check in was told the double room I had booked had been sold to someone else so I was in a twin room Room was freezing with no ability to turn off the air conditioning Tried to order food but nobody available Wifi didn t work Absolutely terrible stay  I had a window in my room bonus 
 On checking in at 2pm there was a used food tray on the floor outside the lift On returning to my room at 1am the following morning the tray was still there  I was amazed at the price I paid for the one nights accommodation such great value and it included a full English breakfast I will certainly choose the Britannia International again 
 The room wasn t clean and smelled bad no natural light I moved rooms and it wasn t much better Breakfast was awful with hard croissants and scrambled eggs that were a strange shade of green Staff obviously don t want to work there and that reflects in the service Really dated d cor Not deserving of a 4 star rating this hotel would be lucky to be considered 3 star  Convenience it is well located
 The bathroom shower was terrible and the shower did not work well My daughter got stuck in bathroom with terrible lock Had to call someone to let her out No fridge to keep water It was near the tube 
 There is a lot to improve here This hotel needs a huge renovation Everything is old and not in a comfortable and artistic way starting from the furnitures the elevators floors and bathroom facilities It s definitely not a 5 star hotel and not even close to it The staff was not welcoming at all Toilet amenities were cheap and of a bad quality The hairdryer was very old The carpeted floor was dusty Even being at the 11th floor the room was very noisy I could hear the train and what the neighbour walking up the stairs The elevator would stop at every floor when going down And let s not talk about the breakfast very poor quality the fruit must have been there since ages and there is no coffee service I asked for an espresso and the waiter wouldn t even know what it was I am often in London but I will try to stay away from this hotel as much as it s possible in the area Such an historical building should be much more evaluated and its potentially very nice furnitures really need a management who cares and understands international standards  The room was spacious and I am sure this hotel must have had a nice history but it needs a huge renovation The location was good if you are going to Canary Wharf 
 not much really  rooms were absolutely gorgeous one had a spiral staircase to reach it Facilities were as you would expect Staff were marvelously friendly and accomodating 
 Staff unfriendly bathrooms tired Fire alarm went off and we weren t told it was a test had to ring reception Dusty fan in bedroom Bed hard felt like sleeping on a rock with a sheet on it Expensive for what it was  Location only one tube stop from O2 arena Bar serves residents late Breakfast good 
 The hotel was very dilapidated The decour was early 1980s and in very poor condition with threadbear carpets torn faded and worn wallpaper and furnishings that were all very cheap dark brown and genrally damaged life expired This is possibly the worst hotel I have ever stayed at and had it not been for the fact that I had already paid and was staying only for one night I would have walked away from it A more depressing place it is hard to imagine staying at and it is not worth anyting like the rates they charge I paid 140 for one night in my opinion I have stayed at far better hotels charging 50 per night I will never go back to this hotel and would reccomend it only to people who want to pay a premium price to stay in a tatty run down depressing old fashioned and quite frankly dreadful hotel  There is absolutely nothing to like about this hotel 
 there is no fridge in the room this is unaccectable for a 4 stars hotel and for the price you pay for The room is very old and need to be renewed I had problem with the hot water and despite I informed the reception staff none came to fix it in five days Bed sheet was already dirty when checked in No Positive
 The hotel rooms have a very tired shabby look Toiletries are poor and skimpy as were tea and coffee Reception staff were unfriendly slow and in one case extremely unhelpful  The foyer is impressive and rooms are spacious Concierge staff were very helpful and pleasant I like the provision of magazines and newspapers Good location 
 Charging you extra for a room with a window Overall clean hotel with friendly and polite staff The bar had reasonable prices too which is always a bonus
 The walk from the metro was a little tricky especially in the rain with bags There were a few maintenance issues but they were handled really well We were offered a room with a window as an upgrade from our windowless booking but the receptionist didn t realise when she told us that the twin beds could be connected that there was a big pole in the middle of the room so it wasn t possible  A lovely quiet and convenient spot Very clean and comfortable Nice to be able to see the water The staff were lovely especially Russ spelling He was very personable and helpful Abdul the breakfast chef was a friendly chap too 
 The hotel was tired looking gloomy and dull especially the rooms The brass on all doors and glass were so dirty and covered in finger prints and smears and that is the first impression that we got which confirmed our whole experience of the hotel The furniture in the rooms were battered and tired It was noisy and the first night I was woken up so many times I used the gym and Spa which was basic and in no way luxorius as the brochure page in our room suggests It again was tired the spa rusty and dirty looking The sauna was NOT hot at all either I felt so gloomy in there that I didn t even use the pool The treadmills you could only use for 20 mins as there was a notice put up over the machines The staff were all friendly though I must stress The Indian restaurant on site had a set menu and looked a little tired but the food was lovely and came quickly  Breakfast was nice Some of the servers who brought the dishes out of the kitchen were so friendly and humble That was nice
 was of the opinion I could book in from 10am to the hotel Arrived at 11am couldn t book in until after 14 00 Had to leave hotel to travel to an event Was unable to shower or get ready for it My partner was very unhappy One of the questions on you booking is what Ike will you arrive I selected 10am booked the hotel based on location but there was no info to state that that area is currently a building site Was unable to access the hotel in the normal route had to take a detour Very dusty and not pretty to look at hotel was beautiful and clean on the inside but outside was very dirty windows specifically Frontage was ok booked a room without a window as didn t want sunlight in morning to allow long lie but was given a room with a window was awoken at 7am by the sun booked that hotel as was a 4 star Definitely not 4 start have stayed in better and more luxurious premier inns Tiny bottle of shower gel and shampoo which was horrid smelling Had to go buy my own Room had a fan but no air conditioning so was very hot booked that hotel as stated it was free wifi This came at extra cost and meant that the work I had brought with me I couldn t complete Overall I booked a beautiful sounding hotel from you website but would have been better booking into a premier in which would regard as 2 star max  Reasonable location in comparison to city centre Breakfast was sublime
 Restaurant is a bit expensive There was no fridge in the room No safe in the room Limited Internet access We found the room very spacious with sofa tea and coffee maker facilities very comfortable beds We booked a special offer for 3 nights in a room without window When we entered we found low temperature but reception offered us a small heating so ok We liked the room and bathroom clean every day Position is really good easy access to canary wharf underground station and DLR only 5 minutes walk It is a Safe and quiet area Beautiful view to the Docklands Friendly Reception Hotel offers leisure services and Gym A restaurant and breakfast room but we didn t not use it Good Price quality in London Internet service log in 20 mins access per day useful We would definitely return here 
 The room temperature was far too hot and the thermostat didn t work However it was late and as only there for one night there was no point complaining  Rooms were clean and comfortable 
 The room was dusty wallpaper was peeling off and the windows were dirty d cor needs updating  bed was a great size even though it was two singles put together good shower good size wardrobe 
 some of the hotel staff are rude I mean some of the male staff More so I counted 5 rats and I believe the hotel management must work to get rid of this rat infestation The location of the hotel itself is nice
 It has 3 place s to eat but only one of the restaurant s was opened for lunch as I ve stayed there before it was the same one which was a disappointment as it would be nice to have the option where to eat It is a very dark interior through out the building noisy in the room throughout the night but to be honest I would stay again  Nice size room comfortable bed big window with plenty of light Had a large wardrobe with plenty of coat hangers and an ironing board which came in handy Ensuite big enough for 2 to move around in plenty of towels decent shower over the bath all in all a good place for a stop over 
 Staff didn t want to listen Everything was at a extra cost Rip off hotel  Treated like a dog they asked me if I wanted a upgrade a room with a view 20 when I got in the room the windows were absolutely filthy could hardly see through them the room wasn t munch better I arrive on my motorcycle I did state this on my comments then they changed me 21 for 1 night I asked to see the manager who was really arrogant and didn t really want to waste his time discussing 21 as he was too busy 5 minutes later he was standing at the bar with his staff drinking 
 For 12 days I was unable to send any emails using the free WiFi service so prominently advertised by the hotel I could receive emails and have internet access to everything but not send emails At all other WiFi available locations I had no probems so the fault lay with Britannia hotels I was smazed to find no mini bar fridge nor room safe nor outside telephoning service from thr room Is this really a 4 Star hotel Sorry 3 5 perhaps  The large room was very comfortable excellent breakfast vast hoies avalale of hot and cold and stewed fruits Good choice of 3 places to eat in the evenings Conveniently close to Canary Wharf shopping malls the DLR and Underground rail systems 
 Nothing going to complain about  The price was very competitive for London I had booked the cheapest room without window and when I asked about an upgrade was given a better room without having to pay a supplement 
 Needs updating some furniture in hallway has seen better days would look better thrown away than just put there Nice entrance to hotel shame is not kept clean Location was fine for getting around London 10 min walk to tube 
 Paying 20 extra for a window Food not great Air con broke during the night and room got hotter whilst trying to get ready  Location is perfect for business in Canary Wharf and the hotel is one of the cheapest in the area Check in was quick and efficient and the room was a good size with a nice view of the Thames
 Had to pay extra for the gym and then an additional charge if I wanted a towel Also the room was so noisy as the tube was directly outside the window so I have very little sleep  Dreadful breakfast Actually had to get my money back as there was nothing I could eat 
 Old and shabby hotel the aircon was not very efficient and pretty loud Old and dirty wall paper and carpet filthy furniture dressing table No internet in the rooms it s the 21 century but in the lobby and available for 30 miniutes only The breakfast was really bad and untasty  The only plus I can see is good relation price location close to the metro and in the middle of Canary Wharf A new TV in the room From what I heard a part of rooms was redecorated so their standard is a bit better I was not lucky enough to get one 
 The room we were in was VERY basic and the beds were terrible I had springs digging into me and therefore did not get a good night sleep  Looked very lavish from the outside and in the lobby 
 Toilet button broken told housekeeper at 10 00 am before leave the room to fix once came back nothing done called to Front Desk at 10 00 PM again to fix it the answer is yes will do Went out to bar and came back 23 59 nothing done the answer was no Engineer available Why u guys should tell me sine in the beginning Moved to another poor room with AC noisy for whole night No one care about these problems at all No Positive
 It used to be a very good hotel but it has not been renovated in at least 30 years so it belongs into the decadent category Nevertheless it was clean and comfortable  Spacious room comfortable lobby great location and views 
 My bed was hard you could see feel the coils The pillows didn t help The internet service poor having to pay every day was my not good The free service advised in the room was ridiculous At Jenny s All you could eat Buffet They needed a better selection of food if your name is International that says it all The juice and water was warm The cups smell If you going to leave them face down you should check if they don t smelled like the mats they were on Dinner was sad the selections were poor One night it was closed You offer alternatives but for the people who paid for dinner What then The other restaurants Spice was always closed As was Fridays The location was nice but it rained so it would have been nice to have a shuttle bus to the Tube  Great trip pleasant service nice room 
 Hair in sink Dirty bathroom shocking The staff was unhelpful and rude I stayed 3 days with family of 4 and they were very uncomfortable to stay there There was hair in sink bathroom was very dirty Not enough towels for 4 of us The hotel said we have to pay extra for the swimmimg pool and also there are no free towels by pool The towels are also extra fee Pool area was freezing
 The building works were so loud and disturbing The car parking charges were extremely high The customer service was poor The beds were very uncomfortable and were twin beds pushed together and they should have been one double No Positive
 Limited free WiFi unable to open window bolted permanently shut needed to use air con all the time bathroom air vent allowed neighbouring room to hear everything Relatively quiet room staff particularly reception very good and helpful room view 
 Breakfast too expensive for what they offer Free wifi and just two minutes from tube station Professional receptionist the guy at the concierge was polite Big room
 Non smoking room stank of smoke Overall decor was in desperate need of updating Bed was like a rock little better than sleeping on the floor Bar staff were miserable Bar was understaffed which lead to long delays getting a drinkNo Positive
 The hotel has a tired feeling about it but that s reflected in the price of the rooms  The whole hotel is in need of a refurb but it still has a quality feel even if it is getting a bit tired now The staff are very friendly and helpful and the location was perfect for my meeting There s enough nightlife and restaurants in Canary Wharf and it s within walking distance 
 Room and hotel is dated and air conditioning was noisy but staff are friendly bar is good value for money and it is a good location for Canary Wharf No Positive
 Hole place needs to be cleaned and painted we couldt buy any coffee in the evening as the bar staff said they where to busy to make it for us also tea bags in the room are not of good quality for the money I paid I expected alot more of my overall stay  Comfy bed
 None The view was excellent The staff were very helpful And did explain everything very well They directed me to the shopping mall which was just around the corner every thing went very smoothly at the hotel rooms very big restaurant excellent with late opening hours Definitely booking again 
 The bed was incredibly uncomfortable really hard There was only twenty minutes of free Wifi which wasn t very good anyway The breakfast was overcooked and of a cheap quality No Positive
 not ultra modern so feels out dated but all facilities in the room were perfectly okay  Convenient location Manned reception tea coffee in the room Traditional style room rather than ultra modern feel
 Rooms are a bit dated But to be honest thats me being really critical Staff really helpful Overall nice hotel Location for attending event at the o2 was fantastic
 Interior of the room very poor condition Cracked floor tiles in the bathroom Furniture extremely tatty Liquid splats up the walls and a fruit pip was left on the Breakfast area was poor tables partly clear My daughters bowl had dried on porridge and coffee and tea cups stained Floor and windows had food marks on them Hotel generally very tired and I won t be returning Very disappointingNo Positive
No Negative Fabulous staff who went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect Fantastic location only a couple of minutes walk to the tube and loads of great restaurants and bars close by 
 Single room is half a room with a full view to a wall not really worth the 115 GBP half at the most You will hear the three elevators constantly Bed is not even you will need to be careful not to fall while sleeping Internet costs 7 GBP per each device  Good knowing where not to go in the future and that I can tell you about it 
 The hotel is quite dated and in need of refreshing Use of swimming towel and towels is an additional cost along with the wifi Staff on reception were rude and unhelpful A staff member happily handed me an email address to complain rather deal with my concerns at the time No Positive
 its a very bad experience for me i would not recommend to any one to go there room was good in high floor the bad experience for me is welcoming the girl who was standing in reception she was so rude seems like she doesn t want to work her name is marina the girl with curly hair she has that guts that she said to me if you want to complain should i give you paper you can write normally first impression is the last impression so far room was ok breakfast is rubbish cold beans hard sausage scrambled egg looks alike hard no staff there to look after the guest the price of breakfast should be cut down No Positive
 The brass on the entrance doors needed a good polish I observed the glass being cleaned but not the brass it looks really scruffy I realise that people touch it all the time but if it s there it needs to be maintained  The beds need upgrading to modern comfortable matresses Kept me awake most of the night trying to find a comfortable position No chance 
 exterior noise due to near the railway and building site next door was only an issue first thing in morning Location very easy to get to the o2 arena 
No Negative bed quite old and uncomfortable windows very dirty couldnt open window aircon noisy lovely hotel quite tired looking but staff helpful great location and fabulous value for money 
 Poor bed size Non co operative attitude of house keeping 5 tray tax even if u buy a bottle of water Very noisy blower in non window rooms Non attendence of your call most of the times especially by room service Courteous front desk staff General decore
 Outlook Unfortunately Docklands is still undergoing development works  Breakfast had a good variety staff were very pleasant helpful friendly 
 Old outdated The mattresses were thin and feel the springs digging in the back Lighting panels had dead insects Paid for an upgrade as we had no choice to get a better mattress  Location
 AC in the rooms was terrible Too noisy didn t really work Wi Fi offer was weak and not very user friendly cuts out every 30 mins and you have to login again The property needs a bit of refurbishment Holes in the leather couches tiles in sauna were broken etc At about 02 00 you ll see mice running around the bar and lounge area Reported to the staff but didn t see any kind of response saw 2 nights in a row  Location was good rooms were comfy Restaurants in the hotel were great Good social spaces Lounge Bar health spa and pool were good value for money Room service came in good time pizza was toasty 
 Decor unfriendly reception  As already mentioned elsewhere this hotel is very dated and in urgent need of a facelift Walking towards it you immediately see the difference in class between the Novetel across the road and the very dated Britainnia Staff member on reception was efficient but with no friendliness what so ever No smile no enjoy your stay Cleaner on the hand was helpful when we couldnt find our room and was friendly Got a cheap room and only wanted somewhere cheap to crash Served its purpose but if you have a little extra cash try elsewhere 
 Noise from trains and building site next door Large room with great views Bath in bathroom Friendly staff Spa great value at 4 per person although a little run down Good location
 The mattress was very uncomfortable and hard well past its use by date  The upgraded room was very spacious and the view interesting The shower had plenty of pressure which is not usual in UK hotels 
 The Wifi is NOT free in rooms only in the Lobby You have to pay 7 if you want wifi in your room which was a surprise because on the site it states wifi was FREE This hotel also has an pool however its not free and you have to pay 4 PP to use the pool and 1 to use a towel now i know why the room was so cheap because the hotel makes you pay for everything  This Hotel has smoking rooms and good location 
 The breakfast was of poor quality The hot food was over cooked and tasted bland We didn t have breakfast there the second day Only 2 of the 3 lifts were working and it took 15 20 mins to get back to the room after checking in Bed was uncomfortable This is not a 4 star hotel No Positive
 Couldn t fault the room but we brought a pizza from downstairs and I m afraid to say it had quite a few hairs in it it was very late so hadn t got time to go back to complain Not much of a view as over looked a building site but then we were only in the room to sleep  Rooms were a lovely size a fan was on when we got in which was very welcome Very comfy beds 
 The bed was pretty hard and uncomfortable It also wasn t very wide Whilst I appreciate you can t necessarily accommodate my 6ft6inch body I have slept in better beds at less expensive hotels The breakfast quality was only adequate The croissants were dry cold and hard The location of the breakfast buffet resulted in congestion and it was poorly laid out e g breakfast cereal dispensers at head height queue for hot food blocking other selections There are lovely low leather sofas in the bar but they look a bit tired now and one had been poorly repaired with black tape The evening carvery looked inviting for me but my wife is a vegetarian and her option was limited to a mushroom risotto  The staff were very helpful and the reception team are very professional Without hesitation they tried for a better room for us The in house Pizza restaurant was good value and the hotel bar prices were reasonable for London The bar area is comfortable and well laid out The reception and waiting area is roomy airy and accommodating 
 Had no windows in room they were going to give us so had to swap to a twin Room was extremely dated Shower head wouldnt stay in position due to being loose Dirty carpet Dirt up the walls by the bin Wallpaper coming off wall in a number of places Staff at bar were rude Stayed in much nicer hotels for half the price No Positive
 Pretty much everything else the breakfast was shocking couldn t get room service no one would answer any of the phone numbers  Size of room view and location
 Room was too hot air con did not work asked reception to send maintenance who just opened the windows second time of asking nobody showed up uncomfortable nights sleep No water in the room room service charged 13 00 for two 1 litre bottles of still mineral water total rip off hotel looks tired decor very old and out dated compared with the surrounding locations reception staff friendly but breakfast staff rude and obviously have undergone no customer training one waiter removed my orange juice from the table before I had finished and took plates while I was still eating toast Coming down in the lift cleaner entered with a hoover then answered a phone call and was being very loud and inconsiderate Would not move out of the way when I need to exit the lift with my bag and made it awkward Very rude and not what you would expect in any customer service establishment Breakfast was not great either more like faulty towers than anything else would not recommend this hotel at all  View
 1 The gym was extra I had to pay 4 pounds per day or 10 pounds for a week 2 The breakfast was rather poor considering the price of 13 50 pounds 3 On two separate occasions as I was having my drink at the lobby I saw 3 mice right beside the window overlooking the canal Quite disturbing I should say 4 The hotel is listed as 4 however the furniture and the bed are fairly old which makes it 2 3 instead of 4 5 Internet was free only in the lobby and had to re sign in every 30 minutes Quite inconvenient for people who are on a business trip  The location was very convenient 
 everything was terrible when you get there everything is extra internet parking breakfast We spent 5 weeks travelling around England and found that this was the worst hotel we stayed in The room had no window it was in the basement the bed was terrible chair in room broken and when we asked for a new one the one they replaced was also broken Staff were very rude because they know the hotel is terrible so they also must have given up with a dont care attitude The foyer very outdated and dirty
 Had to buy own dettol and clean the tub as the first room had hair in it we got moved to a next one and same thing and didn t bother to complain again as the stuff was very very rude  We enjoyed the spa very much
 The room was poor Wall paper was torn bathroom leaked and bed was uncomfortable I had a room upgrade I would dread to think what I was going to have 130 was way too much for this average room without breakfast  Nice staff and they upgraded my room
 I didnt dislike a thing The view from my hotel suite The suite on the 11th floor is beautiful as you walk through the door there is a staircase leading up to the room The view from the hotel suite is overlooking Canary Wharf 
 Breakfast is not very good nobody cleared the table so we had our breakfast with other peoples dirty plates and cups The most disappointing thing is that you don t get a fresh jug of coffee we had to drink from the jug the people before us used It was actually quite shocking I have never experienced this before  The staff was very helpful
 Tv never worked properly Bathroom was dirty Kept awake all night by noisy people on same floor Staff did not seem bothered when I reported this Overall a horrible stay No Positive
 Room bland and first room smelt Had to change rooms first room smelt No info given about facilities at reception and no info at breakfast just free for all food very adequate
 They charge for wireless What is the cost of this to a 4 star hotel at this time and age I think a hotel providing only 20 mins wireless connection as a room service is a big shame in 2017 Their heater did not work either during my stay People are nice but facilities are very limited This hotel does not deserve 4 stars No Positive
 Check in was simple and fast on entering the lift there was a large notice saying keep bags where you can see them and thieves operate in this area The room was ok but very run down It had damp in the corner and the services like hairdryer did not work The worst thing was the rats in the hotel We spotted a number of them and did complain to the reception via phone but was not called back by the manager as promised On check out we explained the hotel was not very clean generally and they had an issue with rats The reception refused to get the manager and told us we needed to send an email They also explained that the rats were due to building works next door and location of the hotel to the river This is one hotel to avoid Needs a good refit and some general TLC It reminded me of the hostels in Asia when backpacking At least those guys were friendly  Leaving 
 Rooms extremely old fashioned Not like photos at all Very dated Small double beds in rooms Staff extremely unhelpful We stayed for 2 nights and on 3 occasions staff walked into our room while we were in there No Positive
 Bed was a little hard and staff I dealt with did their jobs well and were helpful but could have smiled a bit more  Room size view and cleanliness was good Cocktails in the lounge bar area looking at the canal dock was great 
 Staff at reception seemed very inexperienced and didn t really know what he was doing and a manager came out while I was waiting to check in completely ignored me waiting but let another woman come right past me that he knew and he helped her I found this very unprofessional and extremely poor service the room I booked was for a double bed and it was two single beds pushed together I didn t want to waste any more of my evening going back out to complain after the time I was made to wait to just check in very disappointed I didn t booked a hotel of this standard to expect this type of experienceNo Positive
 The heating in the room was broken so extremely cold at night But the room has whole wall of glass so in the morning it s like a warm house can t even open the window so hot and unable to breath  For this price in London is not too bad the room is big
 I asked for a double bed and they gave me two single beds They were highly uncomfortable to sleep on  It was a nice hotel It was clean and good for a short stay 
 Being told to open the door to 2 men from security as they thought we were smoking and no breakfast as I m sure it had that on there when I booked it so I m very angry and would like a phone call from u at some point please  Not much 
 Shaver electric outlet does not work the only outlet that an European 2 prone plug is accommodated Only 1 tea bag is provided in the room Wall paper is worn and wall and bathroom cracks are found around the room Require payments for swimming pool and electric outlet adopter No Internet in the room No easy street access for luggage with rollers from the train station  Price
 I admit that I was tempted by the very convenient price but this comes with a price The hotel is the classic charter mass tourism place Buses continuously offloading million of noisy and hungry tourists The hotel itself appear sort of old England style up to the first steps and then it becomes a monks style environment especially the bedroom cell Definitely a never again  Handy location when using London City Airport 
 The whole Place needs a refurbishment The staff in general were unhelpful and often replied in rude or dismissive manner On numerous occasions and I am very polite They badly need retraining for pleasantness and consideration The door staff basically refused to gather luggage from friend or use trolley to take to my room one wheeled smallest case and left us to struggle with the biggest part The only nice pleasant girl I met was the chambermaid The bed was lumpy The towels were small old and hard The TV was poorly placed on furthest wall Not enough plugs and sockets Bedside lights did not work No one answering reception phones on many occasions Coffee in flasks at breakfast was foul Poor bread selection And poor fruit selection Breakfast dry and disappointing Unable to get room service at all as no one replied  Location beautiful over the water space in public areas and room excellent Lifts good Staff smartly dressed The bath and shower were good The bed large 
 Room very outdated and pool and gym were an extra cost that was not mentioned on booking Food was terrible in the restaurant and the local restaurants were a good 2km walk away  The bar had nice cocktails 
 What looked like a mouse ran across the floor in the first room I was in Grateful for the free upgrade up to the 8th floor which thankfully was mouse free however room a touch warm with air con appearing to be only part working  After the issue in the first room this was resolved by a free upgrade to a better room higher up 
 Very uncomfortable bed A LOT of people in all public areas like reception and breakfast  Friendly staff good location if you re over for business in Canary Wharf
 The place was very bad Had to pay extra 60 pounds unplanned for a room with window The place is not clean flies everywhere I cannot sleep and my colleague was not happy with me choosing the room Staffs not receptive at all Highly disappointed Wanted to cancel but it was too late  nothing
 The staff was not helpful at all The room was extremely dated and the air conditioning was very lacking I had to call the front desk 3 times for 3 hours to get a fan brought up The location is very out of the heart of the city No Positive
 I honestly find no fault For London an expensive place we find the Britannia good value  clean good room food fine public transport nearby good Used this hotel lots of times and keep coming back Reception efficient 
 Long wait to check in I had booked a room with a window but they had it the booking without but changed it for me without no hassle  Great view and spacious room Loved the huge windows 
 The staff were extremely rude The staff had also charged me extra on my card without my concerent which I will be taking it further with the authorities Very poor service Extremist rude Location
 Room was cold with very loud air conditioning but there were no controls in the room to turn it off Room did not have a window which we knew at booking but we did not realise that this would mean that the room would be really hidden away from the other rooms almost as if you were in the staff quarters No one directed us to our room and as the rooms numbers did not follow in numerical order it took us over 15 minutes to locate our room We were actually over the other end of the building to the other room numbers that were in the 100 s rather than with them Mould on the shower curtain was also not a very nice surprise No Positive
 I wanted to pay for my room in cash and I wasn t told at any time in any correspondence that if I wanted to pay on cash then I would have to pay an extra 50 this caused a few problems when I came to check inNo Positive
 I would have liked the room to be a little bit warmer and for swimming and gym to be inclusive in room booking without extra charge  They let me check in early and did their best to make me as comfortable as possible And where very helpful The breakfast was very tastey Food in General was great and hotel is very neat lovely view of the river
 Reception staff tried to sell us an upgrade which we declined only to be told 30 seconds later that we were being upgraded free of charge disgusted at this scam and have e mailed hotel on 4 occasions to inform them of this but as usual negative comments No replyNo Positive
 The bed was so uncomfy The bed was really uncomfortable it was like sleeping on a rock reception was impressive but the rooms were shabby and in need of updating the decor was very tired
 The car parking was abit fussy and the charge times were odd 6pm until 9am but then it was 3 over that time either way Good location Nice and simple and cheap
 Limited free wifi access in room Water from shower over bath spilt over making puddle on tiles Older than appeared on web photos  Upgraded to larger room Handy to all that Canary Wharf has to offer 
 The hotel stay was overpriced The breakfast was budget in terms of the ingredients used and not alot was on offer Definitely wasnt worth 13 50 The remote and phone in our room was dusty The hotel looks very plush on the hotside but not well maintained on the inside with the elevator smelling of cigarette Also the parking 21 for 24 hours are they going to wash it too I would not stay again at all as I dont think I got value for money whatsover The gym is 4 a session too  We liked the location As the location was good for the event we attended 
 It was a little bit further out of the way than I would normally choose not many options for eating out I also stayed the weekend of the London marathon and was blocked out of the hotel most of the day  It was a nice hotel and the people were lovely when I needed help they were more than happy to be there 
 Everything was very dated and dusty We didn t even shower because the bathroom was disgusting I ll never go back in that hotel I usually use hostels for my travels and they are far better than this hotel  The only thing that I liked is that the bed sheets and towels were cleaned 
 not a major big problem but the cups for tea in my room wasn t exactly clean and the toilet was kind of broken It either continue flushing or when I go to use it there is already other people faeces in it  My room was better than I expected and the staff was super friendly The view from my balcony was wonderful and I felt the building had a lot of history to it too 
 1 The bed was the WORST I ve ever slept in It was lumpy and had springs stabbing your back You could even hear the springs move while laying on the bed I booked a double bed and received two twin beds pushed together and there was a huge gap in the middle also on of the twin beds was higher than the other 2 They don t dust The back of the nightstand was all dusty and gross when I went to plug my phone in 3 The cleaning ladies knocked on our door every day at 9am to clean even on Saturday and Sunday Seriously People come home late those days and sleep in 4 The hallway had bugs sitting ALL OVER the walls It was gross Another thing about the hallways is the hotel is like a weird maze 5 The location sucked especially because of construction  I liked the picture on the wall where it looks like you re at the beach I liked the bathroom too and the lobby 
 If this clams to be a 5 hotel I was amazed that there was no mini bar in the room and that no outgoing telephone calls could be made from the room Some parts of the hotel aare showing wear and tear eg scrope marks on the wooden furniture in the rooms stains and wear marks in the busy areas of lifts and public areas It is in need of a spucing up  Buffet dinner very polite and helpful service staff very convenient location close to Canary Wharf shopping malls and eateries and to the Dockland Light Rail stations and network 
 I really can t complain about any of it  It was easy to find from tube station a five minute well lit walk Friendly staff on reception easy check in service The housekeeping staff all had smiles as well Room was clean and spacious with everything we needed Breakfast was lovely and good value 
 Nothing was the worst hotel stay of my life Staff were extremely rude terrible service and ruined my weekend going there I ll never step foot in there again I ve never been spoken to like that by staff anywhere in the world absolute disgrace the room stank the staff embarrassed me in front of my girl friend suggesting I had no money when it was their error and when I asked them to clean the room they said it was done already and I was mistaken 
 Room was tired and worn with holes in walls and flaking off wallpaper in places  Location and price couldn t be beaten for my requirements Bed was clean and room itself was clean 
 This is the 3rd time iv stayed here every time iv booked a late check out and every time I have been rudely awaken by maids knocking on my door numours times on my second stay I had a maid walk in 3 times while I had no clothes on I will not be returning  The fact the maids don t stop knocking on your door before your even awake and have a do not disturb sign on the door 
 The bed was uncomfortable and a definite small double A C didn t work and I nearly passed out  Looks fancy but a poor room outdated and way to hot A C didn t work windows didn t open and were minging 
 The hotel decor was tired we had to tell the bar man how to make a g t pretty basic stuff Whilst we were sat in the lounge a mouse climbed up by the back of the sofa I asked for a non smoking room which stank of cigarettes The only thing in its favour was it was cheap  The location
 The beds was really uncomfortable We first got offered a room with no window and then got changed to a room with a window There was a construction site right outside our window which woke us up at 7am with the building work The room was very dated No Positive
 We had a smoking room but even for me it smelled of years of guests smoking was pretty disgusting no smoking from now on  The bath were very large and the bar area and sitting were nice
 The dirtiest hotel room I ve ever stayed in Stains on bathroom tiles hairs everywhere unwashed saucer with crumbs on Good room facilities iron and board kettle hairdryer tea and coffee etc
 I enjoyed our stay the decor is very dated and it lacks TLC The reception staff were all very nice but I found the catering staff during breakfast to be less happier in their jobs not helpful or nice the breakfast was yuk boiled egg was grey so maybe they can invest in better chefs cooks  our room was amazing Nice size and I loved the spa bath 
 It s very old fashioned you can tell back in the day it would have been a top hotel however it s getting to the stage where everything looks just old  The location was great right in Canary Wharf itself and close proximity to the DLR Underground stations 
 If this was the executive room I d hate to see what the standard rooms look like You have to pay for WiFi hi 21st century calling The decor is antiquated probably last refurbished in the 1970s When we moved the twin beds apart we noticed they had probably been put together to cover the large rip in the carpets The furnishings are so old that even the carpets have faded colour The windows are so dirty that I thought it was frosted glass The non smoking room smelt strongly of stale cigarette smoke Room service were hammering doors and bellowing along our corridor for the duration of 8 9am If room service doesn t wake you up the DLR train will 13 50 additional charge for breakfast We paid 90 for one night I know London prices are more expensive but I ve stayed in cheaper and nicer guest houses and lodges than this Certainly not value for money and not what you would expect a 4 hotel to be  Close proximity to o2 Arena Friendly staff at reception Lobby area looks quite pleasant We had a free upgrade from standard twin room to twin executive room 
 The wifi is paid for after 20 mins at 7 a day The rooms are abit hard to find as they are separated by odd numbers and even numbers on either side The tv could have been bigger Excellent location only 10 mins walk from Canary Wharf station and such a cheap price for a very good hotel The staff were friendly and the room was huge I got upgraded to a window room too which was nice Breakfast was good and had a full buffet with lots of choices
 Cleaning Floor in bathroom was dirty and food was on carpet just by sofa it had been cleaned but obviously had only been done quickly which I think is an issue with most hotels re the staff to room ratio To cover all rooms cleaners have to cut corners I could have complained at the time but it wasn t really too much of an issue considering how much I paid for the room  The staff member who booked me in was so helpful and kind when we realised I had booked the wrong night by mistake She also upgraded me to a room with a window with a fantastic view Although this property is in need of an upgrade and spring clean its a bit of a gem re value for money Would definitely stay there again 
 The hotel could do with a revamp very old fashioned  Girl at the check in desk was very friendly and welcoming Bed was comfy and breakfast was nice 
 Everything about the hotel is incredibly dated and old however this doesn t mean it is dirty or uncomfortable by any means but could do with some modernising  Great location and very well priced for what it is where it is
 There was nothing in particulary that i didnt like  Staff were very friendly the hotel and room were clean and fresh Will definitely go back and encourage a friend to stay over there 
 Stayed at this hotel numerous times over the years and every time housekeeping has knocked before checkout time Check out is 11am I stayed here last night and housekeeping knocked at 9am woke me up 10am so at this point I put the Do Not Disturb sign on At 10 45am they knocked for the third time Absolutely livid This is meant to be a 4 star hotel and their staff are either ignorant or can t read  Location 
 The pool and spa needs to be renovated The poold itself was nice but appeared dirty due to grubby grouting and rust marks on the paint  The prices of drinks and room service was reasonable
 My only gripe is that the staff in the breakfast buffet are too eager to clear tables Frequently I d go up to get some food from the self serve counter and come back to find any hot drink I d left had been cleared away while I was gone At one point I even had to take cutlery from another table as mine had been cleared away while I was gone But this is a very minor gripe for an otherwise flawless hotel  My stay at the Britannia International Hotel in Canary Wharf was fantastic The room was comfortable and relaxing well furnished beautifully decorated and cleaned to a very high standard The staff were friendly welcoming and wonderful From checking in to checking out the entire stay was stress free They offer a wonderful buffet style breakfast too which I thoroughly enjoyed Thank you for a wonderful stay 
 The hotel was a bit dated could do with a refurbishment  Good location price upgraded on arrival and deal on breakfast very clean was a bit worried when we read the reviews but that was unfounded
 Beds were not comfortable Joked two single to make a double Room phone was not working Even though I complained but No one fixed it Room service food was really bad quality  Location Price
 The decor and fittings were a bit tired The room was a good size and comfortable The staff were all extremely helpful especially Melinda in the restaurant
 Very dated for a modern looking hotel in such a location The bathroom was mouldy and the bed as hard as a slab of rock awful and too uncomfortable to sleep No Positive
 I paid for an executive room but didn t get that upon arrival Was upsetting because I always stay at Britannia Had to sleep in a room with two single beds to start and it was my 3 year anniversary night Eventually the next day I got what I paid for and although it was much better unfortunately my anniversary night was ruined  Love the hotel the staff are wonderful and overall place is located perfect for me
 I booked a double room but I got a twin room The bathroom was acceptable but requires a renovation e g grout missing between some tiles  The room was big and with a pleasant view Good location Overall a good experience 
 Paid WiFi only 20 minutes of free No hair dryer in room Extra amount paid for the room with a window not worth it Breakfast no fresh vegetables tomatoes cucumbers etc  Good size room comfortable bed Good and helpful staff Walking distance to two closest metro stations 
 The facility itself left much to be desired It doesn t seem to be well maintained The room itself was nice enough but not very clean and the walls were covered in marks The customer service from the 2 staff members I dealt with on multiple occasions was quite bad Rude unhelpful condescending and borderline insulting  The location is pretty good Relatively close to train station and in the newest neighborhood so the area is clean and easy to walk around find shops and food if desired 
 Nothing all was good Easy to get to excellent bars and restaurants Once you cross the bridge five minutes away Receptionist was brilliant very helpful about my room spindles and breakfast xx
 Breakfast sausages looked under cooked bacon hash browns were hard ORANGE JUICE WAS WATERED DOWN Not fresh juice like suppose to be Needs seriously looking at getting better breakfast for how much you have to pay for it If we stayed again we could be looking at breakfast elsewhereNo Positive
 Very old and dated rooms not very modern very very dated and rooms without window not completely clean Staff didn t seem to know what to do when dealing with my complain about the room we had t change rooms and the room we were given was dirty tiny and bathroom dirty Close to tube station
 The price  The layout of our room was great we were upgraded to a superior top floor room due to a mishap staircase up to the bed was awesome balcony view was great also 
 The air con is a little noisy even when the fans are switched off Wardrobe doors broken in room  I ve stayed in this hotel 2 or 3 nights a week for the last 5 weeks whilst working in London and will stay again in future I agree with others that the rooms are a little dated but they are clean comfortable and a good size for central London It is within walking distance of 3 DLR stations I haven t eaten in the main restaurant but the pizzeria is reasonably good Room service is good but there is a 5 delivery charge There is a well equipped gym with swimming pool on site for a small charge 
 Coffee wasn t great with the breakfast The room got so hot and Aircon was not cold enough The staff who intially served us helped us and gave us an upgrade It was really nice of her as we didn t have a huge amount of money and it was our anniversary We had a room with no window and she upgraded us to a room with a huge window looking over london honestly was the best thing when me and my boyfriend opened those huge curtains 
 I don t expect to be asked three times if I knew that I d booked a double rather than a twin room Yes I did want a double  Quiet and not too hot rooms
 Staff yelling room service at 2 am 3 am and 4 am down the entire hallway Breakfast that wasn t worth the money Double bed was two singles placed next to each other Tried to use the iron it blew the fuses in the room had to flip switches Had to hold kettle in a specific way on the platform to boil water for cup of tea Ultimately neither my fiancee nor I got a sustained amount of sleep and were both exhausted as we were walking in  The hotel was clean The room we had didn t have a window but they did add some colour by painting a wall with a mediterranean view There are a number of building sites in the area we couldn t hear any of it from our room 
 Rooms and decor are outdated heating issues occasionally and last time my floor had a strange smell of chemicals paint but nothing which affected me  The staff here are the absolute best In particular a lady who unfortunately I have forgotten her name i think it was Malina is an absolute star I have stayed at Britannia several times in the last few months and this lady has always been nothing short of amazing Value for money best location wouldnt really change a thing Abdul at reception is also extremely friendly and helpful Great place 
 No minibar in the room and needed to buy water in the shop Windows can t be opened and windows glass is very dirty Hotel needs some cleaning and refurbishment ASAP Limited Wi Fi is free only in lobby otherwise it is pricey  Location is perfect for staying in Canary Wharf and if you don t mind train noise 
 The drivers arranged by the hotel were rushed and often distracted with their phones or hand free head sets which created a few close encounters with other unruly drivers on the road This was a little disappointing given the professionalism and efficiency of the hotel staff  The staff were incredibly welcoming and efficient in meeting the needs of myself and child 
 Building is old not in the good way room is full of disinfector smell Towel is small This is the first time that I was asked to pay for using the gym in the hotel and need to pay immediately The staff refuse to put it on my room No Positive
 Longest check in ages at least 15 mins 4 staff 1 working computers down didnt have my booking challenged me on the parking fee as I said I would be out each day by 9 I was out by 8 and on Bed springs actually made noises  It was a place to stay
 The pillows were too flat they should be a lot thicker The view from our room was horrible due to the building works outside not a nice picture at all The subways were also very loud and very hard to sleep with if your not use to noise We were on the first floor even though we had asked for a room as high as possible Over all it was just too noise to sleep with Also the tv had we had to go to it and change the channel because the remote wasn t for the tv it was a completely different make  The bar staff were amazing very chatty and beautiful manners Rooms are a good size and food was good 
 Didn t answer call for room service for around 20 mins but apart from that good hotel Extremely close to the city not isolated from any shops restaurants friendly staff comfy bed and nice shower
 Bathroom was smaller than previous visit but still very nice  Size of the bedroom was good and had a very open view In addition the staff and location 10 minute walk to subway were very good 
 The room was a box room The whole hotel needs some TLC over priced as the breakfast which was booked wasn t included in the price  Booked the room discription was room with no windows it was a box room with a double bed Also booked the hotel as breakfast was included When arrived I had to pay extra as this didn t include breakfast I ve stayed in better Britannia hotels cheaper too 
 Curtains let in light st edges meaning room never got dark Gym facilities very old but good range of equipment Queues at breakfast even when there at quiet times food ok Convenient general good value
 The facilities were out dated the decor was awful not what I would expect from a hotel in Canary Wharf location The quilt on the bed was thin as the the room was cold I couldn t stay warm There was no mini bar in the room The toilet tap handles easily came apart when turning the tap on and off It felt like a cheap hotel in a wonderful location I would not be staying here in future or recommending it  I didn t have any of the coffee
 I tried the buffet restaurant once It was the worst food I had in years So bad in fact that I walked away from an already paid for all you can eat buffet to buy a sandwich at Tesco My room had no windows The furniture has seen better days WiFi is way too expensive 7 pound day and device  The Hotel has three different restaurants and two bars The italian restaurant and the sportsbar were nice I did not try the indian restaurant Canary wharf is a casual 5 min walk away which is brilliant if you have business there and want to avoid rush hour traffic 
 two of us had rooms in this hotel rooms are a insult to accommodation tiny some without any windows and so noisy you cannot sleep at all breakfast is about the worst experience you can have also lobby sofa out so tied and hardly clean  Location only the rest is not to be recommned
 Customer service leaves a lot to be desired for and I wasn t very impressed that the gym incurred a daily fee especially when it is relatively dated Also wifi is limited to 20 mins per day  Clean and comfortable 
 Bed very hard 134 I felt slightly cold during night Window could of do e with a clean Asnt meant to have window but did Beautiful view Clean tidy great location Fantastic shower Would stay again
 Facility and service The room smells Cash machine is broken No service what s so ever  It was nightmare experience never want to be there again 
 Ther coffee was awful completely undrinkable The worst I have experienced in a hotel As someone who only drinks coffee in the morning and without milk it was not a good start to my day The breakfast seemed as if it had been there a while the bacon was dried out the sausages overcooked The price of the room This room has been available to friends who have stayed there for 75 I paid 145 But it was the best deal in the area  The staff were friendly and very helpful location was perfect for my needs
 Old and past its prime Breakfast is full english Watery orange juice and jelly o passing or jam Threadbare carpets and shaking rattling elevators 
 The beds weren t as comfy as I was expecting  Really enjoyed the pool and sauna facilities Perfect area as well just 20 tube ride from central London 
 The bedroom was ok but very dated I did not see the point of the large dresser in the room I am afraid the bed was very uncomfortable it was like sleeping on a rack I am glad we stayed only one night our friends stayed for 4  The gorgeous jacuzzi bath was such an unexpected bonus in our standard double bedroom we had walked around the Ideal Home all day so was an amazing experience after our long day 
 I didn t like the fact that there isn t any windows in these room I stayed at Birtannia twice as much as I loved it I also suffered from a claustaphobis environment No Positive
 We initially booked a room without a window Staff very kindly asked if we wanted to upgrade to a room with a window paying extra or a twin room for the same price We chose to stick with the no window However we were given a room with a window and a view of scaffolding The carpet in the room was very tatty and looked dirty with stains In addition there were several large brown stains on the wallpaper This had a negative affect on the comfort of the room Left wondering what the original room would have been like  Staff were very friendly Good choice of food at breakfast Nice canoe on the ceiling Bathroom looked quite new 
 Hotel feels old and in need of refurbishment Room smelled of cigarette smoke Smoking permitted Window did not open Shower head did not stay up I had to hold it Toilet flush intermittent TV remote did not work Furniture and decor looks tired Chipped woodwork stained wallpaper cracked sink in bathroom Area around hotel is bleak and uninteresting and under construction  I got a cheap deal at the last minute Walking distance to Canary Wharf Underground Station Pizza room service 
 1 I arrived and they could not accept the corporate Card my Company gave to them and i had to pay with mine 2 The shower did not have Cold Water in the morning so I could not wash myself I said this to the reception When I came back in the late afternoon the reception ensured that the problem was fixed but as soon as I went in the room I realised it was not So I called them Again The plumber finally came and said to me that nobody had told him anything during the day 3 Interent access had to be regularly renewed which caused me several time to go offline with my laptop 4 I asked for a taxi to the reception and a private driver came offering me a fixed Price It was too late for changing so between CW and City I paid 20 Pounds No Positive
 I had to have my room moved as it was so noisy from trains no free wi fi except in lobby charged for swimming pool leisure which was very old tired etc and I didn t feel confident about health risk of sauna or tub as a result the staff were generally helpful and polite the pizza restaurant was pleasant and reasonably priced
 Noisy room could hear the hotel s heating ventilators buzzing all night The double glazing did not keep out the noise Shower over the bath rather than a shower cubicle Overnight car parking charge 15 or 21 for 24 hours Unlimited Wifi had to be paid for  Large room comfortable bed helpful reception staff TV and tea and coffee making facilities hairdryer 
 The rooms overlooking the railway and Canary Wharf are very noisy when the train start running at about 5 in the morning also the room in the spring summer needs the air con on all the time and the curtains closed the air con was also very noisy a humming noise when off The standard double bed was very creaky the windows need another layer of double glazing there is no opening for the windows I would stay again but not on the same side as our room 824  The traditional style of the communal areas and atmosphere 
 The room smelt of old stale smoke It was a none smoking floor so it was either the airconditioning filters that needed changing or the room was close to an external vent where people were smoking The room was on the 10th floor so it wasn t close to an outside smoking area Very puzzling Also the furniture and decor in the room was looking scratched marked and aged Though the room was clean it certainly was overdue for a refurbishment considering it s a 4 hotel in Canary Wharf  Location was great The water was really hot for the bath both days fanatastic And very comfortable bed 
 I think the hotel was overpriced for a 4 I have stayed in numerous 4 hotels and this has to be one of the worst I had paid for a double room but when I arrived I found that it was two single beds pushed together they didn t even put on a double quilt There was an annoying green neon light situated above the door which I couldn t turn off It illuminated the room and as a result I had a poor night s sleep I would recommend looking at other hotels in the docklands area  I stayed here ahead of the London Marathon and the hotel s location served me well I had a windowless room which looked like it had been recently refurbished The room was clean and the bed was comfy 
 The ac wasn t working in our room especially having no windowns in the room the room was boiling hot The smoking room And the room and shower was all clean
 The hotel is a bit hard to find from the underground and its location in Canary Wharf reflects the great value but also how busy the hotel is The decor and facilities are more than a bit dated would have been lovely 30 years ago but it is clean and staff are friendly  Friendly staff good value hotel for London I had a nice room with a great view along the river 
 we booked a double bed and it was two single beds screwed together and two single mattresses on top i had no sleep on the single bed at all as they were singles and not doubles as booked and with it being marathon weekend they were fully booked and we had to run the marathon the next day with no sleep and there was an awful noise from the lift going up and down all night so not happy at all and will be taking this further  we booked a double bed and it was two single beds screwed together and two single mattresses on top i had no sleep on the single bed at all as they were singles and not doubles as booked and with it being marathon weekend they were fully booked and we had to run the marathon the next day with no sleep and there was an awful noise from the lift going up and down all night so not happy at all and will be taking this further 
 It s a shame but there was alot not to like such as staff interaction was poor lack knowledge of the area cleaning staff knocking on the door at 8am regardless of DND sign The wall paper in the room was filthy and ripped the ceiling had unfinished work done to it looked really bad The breakfast was extremely poor but the staff where lovely The main bar Fridays only open for an 90 on bank holiday Sunday 0 atmosphere a shame really No intrest show in accomodation marathon runners with regard to travel advise or meals for overall quality barely scrapes 2 stars  The only bonus is that this hotel was situated on the 18mile mark of the marathon 
 Room was incredibly noisy Could hear everything that was going on in the room next door when they came back at 3am in the morning and shouted and banged doors for an hour Not ideal No Positive
 The very good Canary Wharf view would have been even better if the windows were clean The lobby area was often populated with people using the free WiFi option evidence that the paid option of 7 Pounds is far too high I suggest you trial a promotional offer of 50 off for a week your revenue will easily exceed current levels and your lobby area won t look like a Public Library  All Staff were great 
 Nothing It was amazing  The staff were fantastic Even tho the room was a little dated The view was incredible I have never opened the door to my hotel room to see a spiral staircase I was just like a child on Christmas morning Even after a long journey with heavy bags I shot up that staircase To be met with wall to wall windows looking out to Canary Wharf Stunning 
 I think the hotel could do with a bit more attention to detail when it comes to presentation I feel it could do with a bit of a revamp It s a classic looking hotel which is great compared to all the newer buildings However if it was maintained a to a greater standard if the windows and rooms etc were kept that little bit more gleaming it would have much greater ambiance  The staff at the Britannia International Hotel were very pleasant and helpful The whole experience was as it should be just easy and comfortable The view from our room of the Thames and the city were great and we really enjoyed our stay 
 The place is quite trashy and very tacky not what I would expect from a hotel in such a nice location The room had a stiff mattress and a loud creaking bed frame There was no fridge or cooler in the room No drinking water in the room There was almost zero shower pressure The bath was covered in scuff marks The shower grate was snapped with sharp edges Awful outdated decor in the room and throughout the hotel The staff were completely disinterested A ridiculously early 11am checkout for the room with an expensive hourly rate to extend it to 1pm at the very latest The entire hotel had the smell of burnt toast in the morning even up on the seventh floor  Nice canal view
 The decoration in the room was really of bad taste In general for a 4star hotel the place was neglected the signs showing the numbers of the rooms where printed on papers and some dropped on the floor for days No fridge in the rooms or shower robes The free internet was only 2x20mins per day I have been to a 3 star hotel that was much better than this  I liked the lounge that you could enjoy the view of the river
 Maybe slight noise from DLR train but nothing really to complain about  The location was great easy access to DLR and Tubes friendly staff room clean and everything that was needed total value for money
 room was noisy as overlooked the air conditioning units on the flat roof the bed was extremely uncomfortable  Beer was 4 10 per pint cheap by Canary Wharf standards
 Checked in in the morning before 14 00 obviously knew we wouldn t have access to our room and as we told them we would not be back til late was told all we would need to do would be collect room keys from desk When we arrived back later had to go through check in procedure again Then at 09 00 the following morning had room service knocking at our door to clean room really No Positive
 Interior on the hotel is very sad They should clean it or redecor it  Good rooms good breakfast and good reception staff Other staff needs some training 
 Having to pay for wifi breakfast costing extra This modern day and age this should be included considering the price you at in London  Paid wifi is good but should be free considering other britannia is free Rooms are clean and tidy although dated nowadays Clean bathroom area and large floor space in room 
 the air conditioning didn t work I asked for a room for three people 2 adults and one child and they give me a one single bed room like we are all going to share one bed and one duvet when I told them I booked a room for three people the receptionist was like there s nothing I can do about it this was just terrible service I was a regular customer going on a monthly basis I m never going again now  i didn t
No Negative It was a last minute late night booking and the service was brilliant There were lots of facilities huge rooms speedy check in out service and excellent value 
 I was in room 171 which was quite small and the low ceiling combined with no windows felt a bit like a cave I don t really understand why you charge more for a window Surely a window is the standard for a room Also I think the air conditioning is broken as both mornings at 7 15am I was awoken by it making a very loud clanging sound for about 30 minutes until I was unable to get back to sleep Also the charger on the bathroom light was broken so I was unable to charge my electric toothbrush  I like having a gym onsite Location is ok for Canary Wharf however road was closed so had to walk the long way round 
 I am genuinely surprised you need to pay 7 pounds for wifi in a hotel Also the hotel is starting to look run downed I am glad I got the hotel at a discount instead of the full price The staff also look unhappy and are not friendly  Good location
 Staff attitude and behaviour was absolutely disgusting after checking in we quickly checked back out due to the treatment from staff behind reception desk  Checking out was easy
 Its cheap for the location but does need a refurbishment as it looks very tired Bed not very comfortable  The pizzeria is good value with generous portion sizes 
 It was very cold in the room I ve asked for help so I got some kind of additional heater However the additional heater did not work well and it did not help at all  I booked my room via booking com and I got some discounted price Also hotel location is very good Good relation between price and location 
 I woudl like to suggest to the Hotel management to install more power sockets near the beds Its handy for those with cpap or charging phones though there are lots of power sockets but none really close to the bed  The staff are amazing Specially the evening night manager Mr Abdul Thank you for the upgrade would be my prefereed Hotel in London 
 There little not to like l lovemy herbal teas maybe that could be an additional selection in the teas provided in the rooms I loved the view from the restaurant quite serene
 The entire hotel is in need of an upgrade you can see that once upon a time it was a very opulent setting but now it is simply run down and in serious need of a face lift Our room was near the staff section and so there was a loud noise early morning which woke us and we also had a surprise visit from a member of staff around 6 30 whom I assume mistook our room for another Certainly not 4 but for the price it is good enough  Room was affordable for the location I chose it as I was seeing an event at the 02 It was easy to get to cheap and comfortable Even though we chose the cheapest room which doesn t have a window the room was still spacious and light The breakfast was perfectly acceptable Certainly not 4 but for the price it is good enough 
 The bed was two single beds put together and not a double king size bed So the middle of the bed was falling in as we laid on it The website does not make it clear that the spa facilities are not a part of the package  It was a very nice area to be in and had a very nice scenery 
 The hotel is in urgent need of renovation it is very old and tired and apart from the grand entrance everything else is old The cleanliness was an issue as the suite was dusty and mould on the taps Breakfast was a disaster as the quality of food was terrible Watered down juices and rubbish coffee from a pot on the table which was dirty  The suite had a jacuzzi bath which was a nice touch 
 Old hotel lift  Got a free upgrade from a windowless room to a room on the 9th floor with fabulour view of Canary Wharf Room size is very decent and bathroom comes with bath tub perfect for a bubble bath after a long day s work 
 free wifi in room was only available for 20mins day  breakfast was abundant and room is nice and comfy if you opt for one with window there is a nice view 
 QUEUEING FOR BREAKFAST TIRED FURNISHINGS SMALL ROOMS CONCIERGE NOT HELPFUL SO MUCH WORK GOING ON OUTSIDE THE PROPERTY NEVER A 4 STAR MORE OF A 2 STAR No Positive
 Breakfast early check in use of pool etc all advertised as part of Booking com offer were all chargeable extras Made the trip 40 more expensive than the offer price Friendly staff
 D cor is very dated Power sockets were a mixture of styles and in strange positions Only 20 minutes free WiFi 7 for 24 hours WiFi is too expensive Good location 5 minute walk from Heron Quays DLR Good price especially as the windowless room I booked became one with a view across the Isle of Dogs
 Was advised to switch rooms to have two single beds at the check in as we would get a window view The view was of pipes and the window wouldn t even open Was told we could push the two beds together but all night they just kept sliding apart and we were barely able to sleep The AC was very noisy and if we turned it off the room got uncomfortably warm Found dust in the room and there was no was no toothpaste or toilet brush in the bathroom People in the rooms nearby were very loud at times at night any it resulted in us having s very disrupted sleep Not the first time that I ve stayed here so I am very disappointed  Walking distance from Canary Wharf and surrounding restaurants
 Rooms could do with a touch up stayed in a suite which could have been an ordinary 3 or 4 star room Not worth the full price but with the discount it was good value for money Food was surprisingly well priced and really nice
 Had a non smoking room but room smelt of cigarette smoke Partner is registered disabled with a paralysed left we were therefore surprised to be charged full rates for parking so wont be using this place again  Staff were good 
 The only things that bothered me was it was very cold in the room on the first night but we spent more time in London so did not really spend that much time in the hotel and also the bed was 2 singles pushed together but everything else was nice  The hotel was in a great location in Canary Wharf as it is a very short walk from the tube station When we got to the hotel they let us check in 15 minutes early so that was great When we got to the room it was HUGE I really could not believe the size of the room for the price we paid We went for a no window room which was fine as again the space compensated for that The bed was comfy the bathroom was clean and the lounge area in the room was fantastic would definitely recommend to others 
 Breakfast very overpriced Don t pay their prices get to a nearby caf or something for a fraction of the price Good location lots of restaurants and public transport nearby 
 The room had not been dusted properly The hair drier was in a very dangerous condition it nearly caught fire The furniture was tatty The twin beds were very small and uncomfortable A bad 2 night stay not value for money  Location near DLR
 The hotel was very classically decorated lobby and entrance impressive however the room could be updated slighty to make it more user friendly  The hotel was luxurious and in an impressive location very close to both the train and tube stations Bed was perfect view good 
 There were marks on the walls and bed sheets the windows needed a good clean work definitely needed doing to the bathroom suite The Foyer is lovely however the decor of the bedrooms then lets it down it needs completely remodernising It wasn t worth the price we paid just for one night we wish we d payed that little bit extra and stayed at one of the two nicer hotels near by  The size of the room was adequate and the bed was comfortable 
 We had a pizza in your pizzeria on the evening of April 12th The base was soggy and undercooked The toppings were tasteless Probably the worst pizza we have ever had It cost us about 10 00 which I would like refunded The marketing ploy of advertising relatively cheap accommodation i e without a window And offering an upgrade for 20 00 per night is somewhat we could have done without  It was an OK experience apart from the comments below
 This property is very run down the spa facilities were non existent the pool area is dirty most amenities not working there is an extra charge to use these facilities The lifts occasionally smell of marijuana and the room I was given initially was very shabby with very lumpy beds pushed together This hotel is totally nothing like the photos suggest Thankfully I was moved to a slightly less grotty room after complaining The view from the lobby seating area is a building site with boards to block any view  Nothing 
 I had changed rooms three times also on the 18 th March I ordereed pizza waited an hour to be told sorry we run out of pizza so then had to wait another hour to make another jewzl It look lovely when you first walk in
 Probably change the carpet but not the room style  The hotel staff Andrea very pleasant customer oriented she upgraded my room with window no extra cost beautiful sunrise sunset overlooking O2 Dome on the 7th floor There s a construction site but it didn t bother me at all even the DLR mininal noise great public transport links Also the domestic cleaner was spot on ample of towels clean bath tub shower 
 I think you need to look into the cleaning of the rooms The cleaner was great who I spoke to for more coffee I didn t ask her to come and clean which I could of When I was doing some exercises I noticed onion beneath the sofa and the bathroom floor hadn t been washed The rest of the room was fine  Didn t eat here Staff were very helpful I booked wrong date but they helped me sort it out and upgraded my room It s an old hotel but great value for money Would defiantly stay again 
 The world over complimentary break fast and free wifi are part of the price But I was charged Free wifi was for only 20 minutes it s just rediculous Got two non window rooms they were different sizes for same price Indian Food
 the hotel was expensive for the location and how bad it is room was to small for a double hotel was not clean bed was hard and uncomfortable THE HOTEL IS IN A GOOD LCATION
 mattresses are a bit hard and comfortable  Staff are really nice and love to help you out making sure you have everything you need to have a good experience at the hotel 
 long story short Girlfriend booked a room there was no ac window broken and cant be opened needed another room hotel said only twin rooms available but I checked online and there was a double So I had to book the double and pay for it So we are paying for 2 rooms because of the hotel This all seemed unethical and the heat in the room was frankly dangerous I moved on from this but was still annoyed but what felt like the unfair loss of 65 The next day we moved to another room that the hotel said was cooler and it was for a moment but again there was no AC and no window so the heat eventually stated to build up The cleaner barely cleaned the room when asked to and attempted to just flip over the dirty pillow cases instead of changing them Asked for a fan 3 times before receiving one Attempted to complain politely a number of times 1st manager said he could do nothing Customer services said to contact booking com to attempt to get a refund as if booking com put us in a room where the heating was broken and stuck as 28 degrees and booking com could try and get a refund if the hotel is and I quote WILLING to cooperate Last complaint was to an AWFUL AWFUL manager who essentially said I had to accept the fact that I spent a ridiculous amount of money on a second room that day as hard luck Gave a half assed apology I ll admit to being rude myself but felt justified This isnt as detailed as I would like but in short I kept extending my stay here because the location is the most convenient for my work but this place is just awful and non of the prices justifiable for a 3 star hotel 7 for 24hour of internet on 1 device In 2017 What a joke Sadly just not a funny one  Nothing really Whats there to like The location is alright I guess but anything good about the location has nothing to do with the hotel I like Canary Wharf but again the hotel didnt put the good things there so its nothing to do with them 
 Cleaners just did tidy up around they didn t change bed sheets when I m back to my rooms I check which was same we couldn t open windows hotels walls were very thin you can hear every sound  Staff were friendly and kind 
 It is an old crumbling place Ragged carpets dirty and the room was extremely hot and poorly ventilated The place could do with a renovation  It was cheap and 10 mins walk to my place of work 
 Decor is very dated and in real need of updating I liked the location of the hotel room was a decent size with good air conditioning and the Price we paid was well worth it
 The stuff wore unprofessionAl 2017 to pay for your WiFi in a hotel in london is unacceptable rooms without a widow and broken telephone and withoutTV control No Positive
 During our first evening at the hotel while having dinner at the pizzaria a restaurant part of the hotel we saw a mouse walking the room Of course we didn t have any other meal in the hotel Brittania Hotels never again No Positive
 The towels provided should be a little big bigger as they were more like toddler towels  Bed Comfortable rooms might look dated but give a nice vibe Parking great Not far from Canary Wharf station which is 15 mins away from central London 
 Room was very hot and there is no way to control temperature Continuous noise was there from window No water bottle Bed was not good Will not choose next time this hotel Only location other wise nothing special with hotel
 Staff had little interest in helping me and couldn t book me manually I had to go into booking com to make a reservation The worst services seen at any hotel I ve been too This 2 9 score that is automatically generated is way too generous I d give it a solid 1 5 No Positive
 by far the worst hotel i ve been to in ages mind i am in a different one every week things just don t work staff contradict each other on several occasions for me food is below all standards except the indian restaurant that one is decent there are all sorts of weird hacks like paper ticket vouchers for breakfast in the 21st century and a clamped paper jacket for your magnetic keycard that gets stamped with a red or black stamp to indicate whether your card was preauthorised just look at the irony of that an exchange office that they claim they have but can t exchange 40 on the grounds that they do not have that amount of cash yet then suddenly can when you ask if they are having a laugh and then claim they can t provide you with a receipt for that transaction until you repeat the question about having a laugh when they suddenly can the evening receptionist telling you you can sort everything out upon check out at 4 30am yet the night one next morning insisting it s impossible to charge you and print an invoice until you have a severe fall out and then suddenly everything is possible this booking for an extra day had to be done online because upon my arrival according to the reception they do not do bookings in the hotel i wonder what would have happened if i insisted they did i d booked it immediately upon my arrival and was told everything was settled only to be literally thrown out of my room and told i had to check in again on the last day unfortunately all of that sums up into a strong and lasting impression resembling a cheap sharm el sheikh holiday facility rather than a canary wharf establishment charging 100 quid a night for the room alone  the channel side view from the bar
 Third visit ti this Hotel and the last Air conditioning in any room NEVER works Far too hot Cant open a window Rooms need refurbishing Very much a two star hotel  Location
 The room was very tiered and I did request a walk in shower as my wife is disabled but we was given a bath with a shower which made it dangerous for her to use Breakfast was excellent
 The sound of the DLR at night and first thing in the am I sleep light so didn t get much sleep on nighy 1 I asked to be moved to a quieter part for the 2nd night which was better Bed was uncomfortable  Positioning of hotel to where I needed to be 
 Very old furniture throughout in public areas restaurants bedrooms bathrooms Needs a full upgrade and modernisation There was lots of dust in the various areas such as the desk chair in the bedroom telephone and remote and in public areas The entrance glass and gold banisters were full of fingerprints and hand marks  The breakfast was a good selection We are vegetarian and there was sufficient choice for us The staff were pleasant We booked for 2 nights but had to leave after one night due to our ill child and they happily refunded the parking for the second night and one nights stay fee 
 Very rude staff at the reception and in the restaurant No free wifi in the rooms I was promised with the river view room but got a room with a disgusting inner yard view Impossible to set the right water temperature in bathroom Breakfast area was dirty and hot and smelled sweat No drinking water in the room 4 seriously Extremely needs renovationNo Positive
 Complete disaster The room was set at 32 and impossible to drop the temperature Carpets were sticky Inconvenient location with building Had to pay for all extra facilitiesNo Positive
 Wifi was not included and only allowed 20 mins per day Very old fashioned decor needs updated Gym facilities poor and cost 4 each Value for money as we paid little for staying in London so did not expect anything outstanding Has all of the essentials and room was fine apart from the decor
 Our room when we arrived did smell like cigarettes and it was a good 15 minute walk to the underground  Located well for the 02 arena as we were there for a 3 day festival Rooms were large and clean 
 Staff Girl at reception was lovely room service too Others couldn t care less hotel needs updated have stayed in nicer Travelodges for half the price
 My room had a view to a large and noisy building site The DLR train tracks are near by and very noisy and very regular The room was very warm  Good value for money the cheapest room I found in the middle of London Good for a night out in the local area I wasn t expecting much 
 Confusing room numering odds on one side of hotel odds on the other  Short one night stay so booked room with no window which is a great option if only in the room for sleeping Easy walk to DLR and into London
 Everything apart from the staff are great The hotel could do with a complete overhaul Airconditioning is centrally controlled and you have to send for maintenance to unscrew a window Not typically a good hotel considering location to Canary Wharf Cheerful but not cheap
 The view was of a building site although the room was indicated as without window so this was acceptable The d cor was tired and the hotel could really do with refurbishment  The good location comfortable bed and cleanliness 
 Queues at reception staff very slow and only two staff available for booking in took 25 mins Booked twin bedded room and was given double bed which was not appropriate Could not report request change as booking in took so long that had to leave for theatre Was locked out of room after breakfast as key card switched off Cleaning staff unable to assist Had to wait for floor manager No assistance or explanation from waiting on staff in restaurant re process for tea coffee No Coffs or milk on table so was given cold coffee from table left by another guest No Positive
 My room had old and stained wallpaper the carpet was coming up and the bed wasn t very comfortable The Wi Fi isn t free for longer than 20 minutes I paid for breakfast the night before but it wasn t marked down in the morning resulting in me having to defend having paid  Quiet rooms convenient location
 The bed was very uncomfortable The room and hotel was very dated In need of a lot of money spending on it All the taps in the room had the caps missing off of them No mini bar Breakfast was average Very Dirty windows in the restaurant Gym area sofas had tears in them Very small pool The room bed and main hotel was clean Location was ok to give us access to the O2
 It was not made clear that there would be an extra charge for the use of the gym The wi fi was not accessible in the room We could have done without seeing a mouse downstairs whilst having a drink  All staff were polite and courteous Clean accommodation 
 The hotel is a bit tired looking The bed was not to my comfort hard but as we paid a low price for the night stay I was happy to accept  The staff were friendly and helpful 
 The decor is very tired wallpaper curling away from the walls at the corners very faded carpets across the hotel multiple chips and blemishes in the bathroom windows in the bar area have possibly never been cleaned It looks like it would have been a beautiful hotel when it was last refurbished but that very likely wasn t this century The room was very noisy from approx 6am until 1am due to the DLR and the fact a window in the room was broken open and I wear hearing aids so may be intolerable for a normal hearing person The plumbing was dangerous due to the temperature of the shower consistently veering from stone cold to scalding hot causing my partner to get burnt I found the beds to be very firm which isn t to my liking but may be to your liking Reception staff weren t interested in my attempts to point out the broken items in the room and the duty manager fobbed me off by saying to just email them instead It was very difficult to get my booking amended and resulted in over 45mins on the phone using a premium priced phone line being passed back and forth between departments My free upgrade was a nice surprise and the view over Canary Wharf was lovely Cheap compared to other hotels in the area Breakfast was comprehensive and mostly delicious 
No Negative Very comfortable room Bar facilities were excellent Staff were very helpful The concierge got us a taxi straight away with a phone call every time excellent service 
 The whole hotel is very tired and needs to invest in some new furniture My bath was missing a tap cover dirty drain away and dirty soap dish Although the concierge was OTT welcoming when you arrived if you actually needed anything after that he really seemed very off No Positive
 It was kind of shabby It didn t feel that clean  The location was good it was great value for money the staff were helpful professional and friendly 
 Double bed too small would opt for room with king sized bed next time Decor very old fashioned Toiletries minimal No herbal teas  Location staff 
 I forgot my phone charger I left it plugged in to the wall behind the chair had to call 6 times got disconnected each time before someone could tell me they didn t find it I was 100 sure I left it in the room It was only when I was on my way back to the hotel they called me back to confirm that they found it and I could pick it up A lot of hassle for nothing but at the end I am glad I got my charger back  Check in was quick and professional Check in staff was friendly and very helpful The room is out of date but comfortable and good value for the price I paid There is a swimming pool which I didn t use Reception is open 24 hours There is tea and coffee and we even got more when we asked If I am near Canary Wharf again I might pick this hotel again if I can get the same price Ohhh Parking available Very handy 
 The dirt on the main enterance glass  The hotel is in a nice location but the main enterance glass doors need cleaning as it is so dirty and make it look like the hotel it self is not clean however the room was clean and airy The reciption staff where so lovely and friendly every welcoming 
 The pizzeria has the worst pizzas Ive ever tasted Pizza Base not fresh and toppings were bland Very greasy Wasn t happy at all The Indian restaurants food was nice A little salty but I enjoyed it 
 Check in took too long checked in by a trainee Room checked in initially had an issue Duty Manager took so long to rectify problem  The room we were upgraded to
 Small room when you compare the price and pics also you booked double bed and got two single beds are made by homel and between two single beds there is a long line and when you r sleeping disturb you alot and pay for this 109 pound no free Wi Fi as well To be honest I stayed many hotels 3 stars 4 stars and etc but this hotel 4 stars and give you nothing if I can rate the hotel again I would like to give 2 stars Overall very disappointing time so next time never again  Not some much things really 
 Decor was dated lots of wear and tear in both room and bars walls paper thin didn t get a good sleep due to noise won t be returning or advising anyone to stayNo Positive
 Building work around hotel makes transiting to from Canary Wharf difficult Hotel very tired and windows filthy Restaurants mostly appear closed Staff in general seem very inexperienced and not interested Bed was extremely firm and therefore too painful to sleep on Give this one a miss  The location
 We were on honeymoon and although given an upgraded room which was very nice of the staff our bed was two singles put together so that wasn t as good but still comfortable Haveing to pay for wifi access was a pain and even though you could have 2 lots of 20 minutes free time per day in your room this wasn t long enough especially when trying to plan activities and transport for the day There was alot of building work happening right outside our window so this didn t give us the best view but didn t interrupt our say atall as we spent most of our time out of the hotel only returning in the evening Room decor was very dated and aged as wallpaper was peeling away in places and there was scratches on the walls also so could do with some modernisation but overall good  Comfy bed breakfast lovely and plenty to choose from Staff very helpful and friendly lobby was nicely presented and bars and restaurants in the hotel were very good 
 Useless bunch of people at hotel reception Everyone asked and stated somewhat different about the payment status of my room needs to send around credit card details and whatnot over email room was prepaid in advance by the way No Positive
 Bed was very uncomfortable springs digging in my ribs all night No window in the room for an extortionate price House keeping came at 8am Breakfast was average food looked like it has been standing for a long time  Efficient reception staff Room was clean 
No Negative Room was warm not sure if the A C was working I put on the fan at point 3 but I still felt room warm hot luckily I spent only couple of hours in the morning else I would have been roasted chicken
 Faded glory Lovely chandelier in the room but with wallpaper peeling off stained chairs and marked carpet it was a tired looking room If it was an upgrade to executive I would not fancy the standard room  Good breakfast selection although we had to pay 13 50 each Impressive lobby We were upgraded to executive room at reception One stop to o2 arena on underground 
 Bed could have been a little comfier My room was a vast interal room a little strange not having a window but the height of the ceiling helped to not make it too claustraphobic My main problem was noise from some other residents 2 doors down from me at 2 30 am who carried on partying until 3 30am Really antisocial when you have to be up at 6am for work however not really the hotels fault No Positive
 If I had to say something negative it would be about the simplicity of the bar  Nice clean hotel staff were friendly and helpful Late bar and pizza take away for residents was very much appreciated 
 I had stayed here on three previous occasions so was a little disappointed to find that the d cor had just grown even more tired than usual Little things that for the price paid should have been fixed as part of the day to day maintenance The bathroom had mould in along one side of the bath the fitting for the soap dish was loose and fell off when I knocked it The tap covers on the shower were missing and so the whole thing just looked dreadful In the room itself the bed was very hard and uncomfortable and parts of the paper had started peeling off the walls there were water stains where the kettle had been boiled against the wall Why oh why does a business based hotel in Canary wharf charge for internet It s difficult to login and the hassle and payment just made me want to cry in the end I gave up and used my work phone to get internet access The breakfast in such a prestigious hotel needs looking at food was either cold overcooked or both many of the items in the hot buffet tasted like they had been sat in the heating trays for a couple of days a tray of fried eggs fresh from the kitchen had yolks that were rock solid the first day I gave it the benefit of the doubt but the second day just awful Check in was a tortured affair with a not fully trained member of staff left unsupervised it took four goes to get a card authorised then the extras were not added so the fifth time we were lucky I was asked three times if I had a car and normally this would not be problem but at 10 30 at night after a busy day I could feel my patience getting tested Britannia if you want your guests to enjoy their stay you need to get check in sorted and more efficient  The location is excellent for Canary Wharf The room was very clean and basically comfortable the facilities on offer are generally acceptable and there are three types of food in the hotel itself ideal if you are tired and not wanting to go far 
 This hotel is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in for some time The room was tiny and very hot The a c did not work properly The restaurant was dreadful Almost inedible pizza The car park was like some kind of building site Everywhere was tatty and in need of refurbishment I ve known hotel stays at budget hotels better than this Not good enough  Nothing 
 free wi fi in the room only for 20 minutes todays is really funny and adapter not to lend only possibility to buy for 5 pounds are you joking No Positive
 sick to death of queuing in reception systems used are completely inadequate for the demand  helpful of staff in sports bar when ordering food nothing too much trouble
 I would never stay here again as the lady on reception was the rudest person I had come across She needs a lesson in customer service She kept trying to grab a Groupon leaflet that we said was not for this she was awful Then tried to put us in a dearer room which we did not want When we left she did not even thanks us for staying We said bye and completely ignored us I was disgusted She was European and youngish Dreadful lady and I am sure she has had many complaints as was so rude  Location
 Furniture was falling apart No air con The air conditioning didn t work had to wait an hour for someone to come and all they did was open window would never waste my money there again 
 old plugs burn out my travel adaptor no free wifi for residents only 30 min free wifi and you have to sign up with an email address great area close by transports and restaurants carpet dark room not great lighting no plugs close by the bed
 Sunday morning at 2 00am the fire alarm in our room went off and then stopped after around 2 3 minutes No one rold us what was going on Window we re really dirty and backed onto a building site which started up at around 6 30 Monday morning this room was supposed to be an upgrade from our original booking When having our room cleaned staff gave more tea coffee but no milk and dirty towel still left on floor when we got back Verbal fight in the lobby on Saturday evening between a drunken couple swearing and threatening eachother Went on for a good 1 2 hours before anyone decided to get rid of them  Staff cleaned room whilst we were out
 Room was not good as no window and the hotel price is too much for the booked room specially as breakfast was not included location of the hotel was closer to Excell London Exhibition where my conference was held It was not so far from Metro underground station
 The room and facilities were generally worn The bed was well used and therefore had grooves The room was very hot and difficult to cool down and no windows opened I had to change room as the TV in my first room did not work The staff were reluctant to move me which I understand but having a working TV when travelling alone is a basic expectation This is a one night max hotel staying for any longer would not be tolerable No Positive
 The hotel is a bit dated but has a good location Our carpets were ripped and coming off the floor he bathroom had a strange smell We were on the 7th floor and after a tiring day going around London all we needed was a good sleep only to be woken around 3 am by a drunk woman banging on someone else s door We rang reception who then came and got the woman out but she was back within half an hour which meant we didn t sleep thereafter The staff the next morning did not offer an apology and told us they were unaware this had happened We were given an email address to complain if we felt like it No Positive
 The staff and the manager are lacking adequate customer care The facilities in the room were dated likewise the decorations The toilet seat was broken on checking in the room and after been reported to the reception was told to come down from 10th floor to the reception to collect new magnetic door card for another room Only by citing lack of customers due care that the reception changes the decision to send someone to bring the new card and show us the new room having to carried our luggages without offering assistance The second room too has a poor t v reception and only to report that once again and to be told that it will take almost 25minutes for someone to come and resolve the issue It was a real nightmare and poor value for money despite the upgrade The breakfast was very dried up especially the fried eggs bacon and sausages The breakfast restaurant also dated and opened floor panels showing rotten floor boards with different patches on the carpets The hotel used to be our family Xmas dinner and last attended about 10years ago and seeing the same floor carpets layouts and decorations still remained the same not to talk about the underground car park unkept  The location was superb
 i booked a double bed room and ended up with two single beds which also had a dead fly on the bed upon arrival bed sheets were quite hard on the skin which isn t the best for someone who has eczema  location was very good short walk away from canary wharf station
 1 No wake up call on my last day 2 Easy armchairs left a lot to be desired 3 Construction Site all around hotel 4 DLR was very close and noiseyNo Positive
 Free WiFi did not work in my room as advertised so I did not try paid WiFi There was a Jacuzzi in the bath but it did not work  The bed was very comfortable as was the pillow 
 The Hotel was dirty windows very smeared and streaked so could not see outside the bed was like sleeping on an ironing board and the pillow the same Breakfast was truly disgusting mess everywhere in the dining hall salt and pepper missing out of virtually every cruet pot the self service area was a mess the scrambled egg was dry like rubber the porridge was caked 3 inches deep to the wall of the cooking pot the bacon was a blue grey colour the fried eggs were swimming in oil the sausages were deep fried to cremation the coffee smelled terrible cheap the staff had no care for their jobs with what appeared non existent staff motivation and the cook s clothing was badly stained and dirty yet he was allowed to come out to the dining area to replenish food supplies with even more sad looking food if I was assessing this my profession is in internal auditing establishment from a company perspective I would fail it on many levels where food and staff were concerned and would insist on a plan of action by the General Manager to vastly improve immediately No Positive
 The room was way to hot even thought the fan was on  i like how suitable it was for me and my partner and how close it was to the underground and how friendly the staff are how lush the food it and how clean the place is 
 1 The bathroom looked like a converted disabled toilet The mirror was so low I could t see above my chest Also the basin was so small it s a good thing I stayed for just one night and didn t need to shave or I would have struggled with the low mirror 2 Confusing room numbering and directions to the room very nonsensical  the size of the room I didn t mind that it didn t have a window
 Room on the 2th floor was very noisy due to I believe a broken ventilation system just outside the window I usually do not have problems with noise but that was a bit too much Could not sleep the whole night Needed to change room They kindly assigned me a new room on the 9th floor much better but I could still hear the noise First time in quite a long time that I do not have free wifi in a hotel room Room furniture might need renovation Breakfast variety and quality might be improved  Kindness of staff Very responsive and helpful Size of the room Position very close to Canary Wharf metro station 7 8 minutes walk 
 We had 4 cleaners house keeping knock on our door between 7 and 8am they knocked and walked in to the surprise of me and my partner sleeping in bed With the do not disturb sign  The bed was comfy The shower was nice and powerful Excellent placement for the O2 Arena
 If I had to be really picky think of just one thing for a hotel room that felt luxurious in every other way there were no large bath towels Everything Proximity to Canary Wharf Docklands standard of hotel facilities feels especially luxurious for the price within London hotel room incredible for price location with floor to ceiling windows kingsize bed sitting area dining table chairs cabinets large bathroom with jacuzzi bath etc Amazing 
 They didn t warn you that the hotel is near a construction so it is very noisy even in weekends 7 am Soft mattress the water kept running out off the shower When I called to reception complaining about it they asked me to come downstairs to get an email So I had to go downstairs at the middle of the night and after they gave me the email to send my complaint I asked to talk with the night manager Although he was there he took his time to attend me He ordered me to sit down Because I refused to do it he left me talking by myself Very rude and impolite I wrote to the email they told me asking for refund and until now there has not been any response from the hotel The business I attended was with London people and when I shared my experience they told me that the hotel has a very bad reputation on customer service but it was too late This have been one of the worst hotels I ve ever stayed I was so angry because when booking I asked for a quiet room They should have told me of the near construction  I must say that the only thing good about this hotel was the food Everything else was a disaster 
 I had no room in my window It was extremely hot and the air con didn t work AND i wasn t allowed to use the facilities without paying an additional charge Absolutely outrageous I was there for work and unfortunately did not sleep well for 3 nights What hotel in their right mind would put a guest in their room without a window For such a prestigious hotel I was extremely disappointed No Positive
 We were several People for a conference The room temperature ranged from 18 to 30 degrees and was impossible to control with the aircon heating control I used an electric heater provided in the room all night long which I fear could pose a serious fire risk No Positive
 On check in nobody gave me the option for breakfast Booked a room without window but had a broken window Reported this at 3am as it was freezing and a chap tried to fix it but couldn t and then left No Positive
 The tv didn t work and Also the bubbles didn t work in the bath The bar staff were more helpful than the lady on reception And we liked the bed and room
 The views were bad all we could see were offices and the hotel in front of us The wallpaper was old and falling apart in the room and in the whole hotel in general the hotel itself was quiet rundown and needs some love and affection Also there are tones of road works around the hotel with various roads leading up to the hotel closed which made it quiet complicated to reach the hotel Not the best location in the world and wouldn t go back  The bed was quiet comfortable and the size of the overall bedroom and bathroom was good 
 Nice hotel but a bit tired inside for example the main staircase carpet is showing lots of wear Breakfast is OK but limited choice particularly if you don t want a Full English  Decent sized double room 5 Minute walk to bus DLR or Tube or most of the offices around Canary Wharf 
 Although we did get an upgrade on arrival from a room with no window to one with a window the beds were too hard and the noise from outside consistently noisy through the night which meant we did not get hardly any sleep We paid for breakfast at the hotel as it wasn t in our room rate it was very expensive 13 50 each and the quality of the food and the service was poor We would not stay at this hotel again or recommend it to anyone else  The building and hotel generally in arrival look good The communisl areas were also good and the staff were friendly 
 The rooms are very old fashioned It stank of stale cigarettes It was dusty and the bed sheets were stained Was surprised as its a 4 star would rather pay a bit exta for somewhere nicer needs a revamp The view and room service was good
 The hotel is very tied and needs a good overhaul The bed was not good slept on springs Too much building work going on around the location however this is no fault of the hotel The swimming pool area is very dated and not the cleanest I ve seen  The price was good for what you got location good The staff were friendly 
 Establishment looks a little tired could do with a refurb or touch up inside Beds were a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on room could be a little cleanlier In house Pizza restaurant was a little disappointing quality of the pizzas could be improved  Staff were very friendly and helpful nice bar lounge area Easy to get to the 02 arena 
 You can get attacked by gangs right in front of the hotel and there will be no security to protect you People from a different pub came to help thankfully No Positive
 Staff were very unpleasant Chair broke in room and could have been seriously injured Also threatened to charge us for it when it had been previously broken and still left in our room Had to pay to use the gym  Location
 Although overall very clean shower curtain over bath was a bit mucky at the bottom  Nice clean room Had booked windowless room as only there one night for visiting my daughter but got free upgrade to windowed room Did not eat there only had coffe and tea in room 
 When I arrived with my husband I was asked if I wanted to upgrade to a window room as I only had room without window so I agreed only if my view wasn t construction sight female gave me me a room with windows but only had view of construction sight do had to go and ask to move which I moved to room 810 which annoyingly had to separate single beds I then ordered a pizza at 12pm from food counter went to collect and was told it would only be another ten minutes so I waited and waited to then be told they have no pizza I waited an hour with no apology just that they HD need busey so wasn t happy also I thought the whole pool area could do with a refurbished as very dirty The hotel itself was OK location not to bad staff helpful sort of
 It was a bit dated paint peeling off the wall in places and old decor but all this hotel needs is a bit off a face lift  It s location is great and the bathroom was nice and big we only stopped the one night but everything was good the food was fine the drinks were a good price something like 3 50 for a bottle of beer Nice views from the public areas decent gym and pool 
 Room was dirty including weird flies in March Breakfast was disgusting Cost only 10 Pounds but I could not drink the coffee and eat the food Staff was unfriendly I wanted to return my pre purchased breakfast vouchers but they did not let me I did not dare to check out the gym and spa It was cheap compared to real hotels
 We had to pay for hotel parking old decor that is beaten It was a 4 star hotel some time ago but not sure this is the case anymore  Good price I had even a free upgrade from a no window room with double bed to a room with twin beds and window with a really nice view I didn t even ask for it it was offered to please us better so that s nice 
 All we heard at night was creeking metal from building site and the beds was not comfy at all woke up with bad back the duvet covers were not big enoughNo Positive
 The decor throughout is very dated and tired in parts of the communal areas the carpet was thread bare and had been repaired with duck tape Our room was particularly shabby definitely NOT a 4 star hotel  Breakfast was good
 I booked a double bed and got two single beds and the kettle wasn t working and to have someone keep knocking the door at 8am the cleaners put me in a bad mood The staff late hours of the night
 Everything else about the hotel was crappy No where near 4 star Hotel was tired the toilet flush didn t function properly and was leaking all night and the maintanence could come only in the morning There were construction around and extremely loud  Location was decent
 The bed was making sounds It was a double bed but they had put two single beds next to other The room was extremely cold with no heater You pay extra for the Internet  Location
 Nevertheless there are number of things that can be improved and not all will have an impact on their profitability 1 Internet in the room has to be paid Most of the hotels include this in the daily rate and even if I paid once for the service I had several problem of connection actually money wasted 2 Water in the room 1 or 2 500 ml bottles is a normal practice in good hotels 3 Flexible breakfast arrangement allowing the guest to have a breakfast whenever she he wants is to me a better arrangement than obliging to commit all days of the reservation 4 The room service was not efficient and in 2 occasion I had to remind the reception of doing the room In one instance they forgot to do the room and then in the afternoon was too late I also asked twice to have the shampoo and shower gel In both occasion they forgot to supply the material 5 The telephone in the room is not designed to make national and international calls so basically this hotel is not good for business trip when conf call are needed 6 After 7 days having paid a fair amount I have asked for a late check in I had to pay GBP10 for each late hour Although I got a GBP10 discount to be honest most of the hotels has given me this for free I have never paid a penny for a late check out 7 When in the hotel restaurants I had to pay straight away rather than paying the difference at the check out Very disappointing to order coffee lunch and whatever else and be always with a credit card or cash to pay the balance immediately 8 Breakfast not a good selection of food Croissants and ham were really bad 9 To access the swimming pool and or the gym there is an entrance fee if I did not misunderstand again most other hotels offer this service for free 10 The bed was with thin mattress and during the night I could feel the springs jumping and making strange noise Not very comfortable  Location maybe competitive price
 The temperature in the room was sweltering Just plain H O T It was a nice and sunny 15 degrees Celsius outside I entered the room and the thermostat said it was 23 5 degrees in the room I turned it all the way down to 16 as low as it would go but when I woke up in the middle of the night the temperature was 25 degrees C That s hotter than most summer days in the UK haha I think I only slept about 3 hours because of the heat Also the lady at reception was verrrry grumpy  Dichtbij de metrohalte Canary Warf close to subway stop Canary Warf 
 The hotel is quite dated and in need of a makeover The temperature control in our room did not work and it was like a sauna rang several times for a member of housekeeping to sort it out After numerous calls someone came and told us it was broken offered to move us but not at 11pm Opened window to cool down the room which meant it was noisy throughout the night  The location of the property easy to travel around London
 It was dirty and the second floor smelled of something putrid I saw a dead body was carried out I think it should be known if we were staying needy to a dead body I asked the staff and they didn t say anything I d like to have known what was going on The smell was disgusting I was planning on staying an extra two days but had to leave I was also woken up at 4am by music next door and then 8pm by cleaners and 10am Far from a good nights sleep No Positive
 Light in hallway on all night Leaked into the room so couldnt sleep Spa pool area was filthy and dated Sauna was unclean with a damp floor as opposed to a wooden one like most saunas are Cost extra to use the gym and spa Paid 119 for the room so this was ridiculous  Desk Staff extremely friendly
 Saturday night the room next door had pre drinks and kept me awake Every morning I was woken by slamming doors and cleaning staff shouting to each other down the corridor  The room may not have had a window but it did have a full wall taken up by an image of a balcony a beach and the sea So I probably had a better view than reality 
 That you have to pay for facilities even though u are a guest in the hotel there shouldn t b an additional charge The facility s of the gym an pool
 Pillows and a toilet in a bedroom This is a 4 star hotel and I had a high expectation However pillows were very uncomfortable and a toilet bowl was very difficult to flush The room was a bit old but to be fair it was a good size and good view Some of members of staff did not khow how to smile to customers Also it was noisy during daytime because there was a building construction nearby 
 The beds are old and not that confy There is no option to open a window No free internet only 20min No mini bar in a room The aircon is dirty and you dont want to turn it on The level of cleanliness is good meaning you can walk barefoot in the room and you want end up with a sticky feet or feet full of dust and similar
 The fact we had to pay for the facilities in the hotel The hotel was very shabby with the lack of investment in the hotel very clearly on show  The only good aspect of the hotel was the location
 Room so small you couldn t walk around the bed without hitting the wardrobe NO WINDOW in room Very stuffy Bed old and furniture dated Room service knocked on door at 8 00am Awful would never stay here again Shower was good
 Unable to alter room temperature which was often over 30oC Adjacent to building site noisy during the day and sometimes through the night too  Reception staff were polite friendly and helpful 
 They told be I had a room without a window never heard of hotel room without window so I upgraded to room with window We had to be moved from the upgraded room at 1 45am as the air con was broken and room was 27 degrees There was no maintenance staff on site to open our window The third room we moved to had people next door as it had adjoining door that started talking and arguing at 5 30am so we basically had no sleep someway to spend our second anniversary You at booking com have a responsibility to us your clients to make sure we get a service for our money 170 And I expect you to get my money refunded I use your service at least 10 times a year so I expect respect from you Regards Tony location
 Air con didn t work properly wouldn t go lower then 16 then kept going up and it was a hot day the staff at swimming pool was she told me it was open till 7 then she came over at 6 30 and told us to get out with a miserable abrupt voice didn t say it nicely at all Nice spacious room not far from train station
 the hotel is old and needs to be refurbished there were broken and missing tiles in the bathroom old drilling holes in the walls and rust from the shower on the tiles in the bathroom location and price are good if you want to be in Canary Wharf
 The room was too hot 27 degrees There was only an ineffectual noisy fan system with which we attempted to cool the room It went down to 26 5 degrees The fan was too noisy and dusty to use for very long No Positive
 The bed wasn t big enough for the size of the room The TV was tiny The hotel needs an overall upgrade The view wasn t great  The room size was impressive The balcony was brilliant 
 Self service carvery dinner a number of food items were gone when we arrived with family and it felt more like a canteen food was basic desert was a little frozen  Room large very comfortable clean view of the river and reception staff very friendly and helpful breakfast very good too 
 The Italian restaurant I had lasagne cannelloni too Both were like a soup sloppy tasted like they d used a jar of sauce to make it I didn t enjoy it at all Location close to canary wharf 
 Nothing  Probably the best hotel we ve stayed at in regards to value for money The room was huge and so clean The breakfast was fresh and something for everyone s taste A brilliant stay and will definitely be back next year for the country to country festival at the o2 arena 
 The temperature needed to be changed in the room as it was too warm but I wasn t able to do that I couldn t use the tv very well awkwardly positioned and very limited channels No HDMI could be used And there was limited sockets in the room  Buffet Breakfast was an awesome idea and I really enjoyed my breakfast The room was a good size room to breathe En suite bathroom was lovely and clean and the staff were all very welcoming 
 Seemed understaffed Waited five minutes to speak to someone at reception no one at the concierge desk at this time then there was a language barrier which was very frustrating mainly at the concierge deskNo Positive
 Hotel music outside the lift could be heard in our room while trying to sleep but turn off immediately by staff when asked  Excellent location Helpful staff Good facilities Relaxing spa 
 Room whilst functional and fine for size and good view was pretty grim Very dated c 1980s pretty tatty and I was very surprised that there wasn t free wifi in the room that s pretty ubiquitous now isn t it  It was the closest hotel to where I was working Good view from the window Room had everything I needed so was fine functionally just lacked any style or quality 
 Rooms without windows Also it was not clearly advised on the site that using swimming and gym in a 4 star hotel was not part of the deal  Room old fashioned style
 Every where i travel have free wifi This hotel gave you 20 minutes or less per devise for your stay And wanted to charge a extra 7 pounds more Everyone in this modern world need to have a good wifi connection  reception staff were very helpful and explained everything well There was no heating on in the room when we arrived And it was very cold day and we requested for the heating to be switched on The housekeeping staff mentioned it was on a timer and did not come on until the evening They did bring us small electric heater which was not really adequate for the room The housekeeping staff could have been more friendly as they seemed not really happy to be working and when asked question they seemed not helpfull 
 Paying for parking as we were staying at the hotel 5 for a tray room service How would your staff carry it without one And 5 to pop the Cork of a wine bottle I m in the wrong job  Bed and location
 Really noisy room must have been near industrial fan or exhaust Bathroom is pretty dated  Excellent location about 5 minutes walk from Westferry Circus Great staff on check in who were helpful and interested Hairdryer ironing board provided 
 missing bulbs on the hall way toilets in the gym and swimming pool not clean although you paid for the room you still pay for swimming which water wasn t the cleanest parking not safe and not clear indication spacious room
 Room really hot cooling not working Hotel is a little tired but served a purpose Paid 126 which I consider expensive The Thursday night would only have been 60 which is a more realistic price  Good location 
 Breakfast is very poor substandard ingredients ie sausages and bacon poor quality Dining room and Common areas dated and not very appealing Room had recently been renovated so better than some of their other roomsNo Positive
 the Italian restaurant menu said pictures were indicative they weren t wrong it wasn t a freshly made pizza it was a factory made one and a poor one at that worst pizza I have ever had by far close to my office staff friendly and swapped me to a different room at no charge 
 We had dinner in the Indian restaurant on site and as we were finished a mouse ran across the restaurant floor There was also an ant in the teat coffee set up in the room No Positive
 Fact they were trying to make myself my partner and 3 year old daughter share a room after I had clearly booked for 2 adults and 1 child They were very reluctant to give us another room but did in the end A room next to a building site that started at 8am fair enough but right next to a crane that made a Lound noise all night with the wind Worse than a dripping tap And our sink kept blocking up  Was clean
 The piped music that echoed throughout the floor all night don t stay in room 115 if you want quiet Great location and extremely cheap for London Room was clean and functional for 1 night
 Dinner was supposed to be a carvery Leek and potato soup was brown and tasted of yesterday s Cabbage Roast beef only vegetables on offer was potato wedges and carrots swede and peas mixed watery gravy Desert was apple crumble tinned apple pretty made crumble packet custard Such a let down  Staff excellent warm and welcoming
 The first room we were given was flooded there was water all over the bathroom floor and despite booking a double room the room had two single beds The second room after going back to reception to ask for a new room was a smoking room and the smell hit us as soon as the door opened Being non smokers this was inconvienient To use the facilities in the hotel pool gym it was an extra charge on top of the price for the room Considering this is a 4 star hotel you d have expected that cost to be included  The staff we dealt with were friendly and the location of the hotel was great 
 Price of the wines were very dear the large glass is not noted in the menu which I hadn t realised I saw two prices and ordered one regular and one large Red Rioja which came to over 21 very expensive and misleading in the menu I mentioned it to the bar maid who s customer service was very poor in comparison to other members of your team who were brilliant She simply shrugged and said that was the price end of  The room was fantastic the windows and decour was beautiful Yes the hotel is a little dated but it was spotlessly clean and for the price we paid was fabulous We will certainly stay again 
 I definitely hated the coffee few options saturated with fat products average service and the Italian restaurant poor artificial food I was able to spot some spider webs in my room which is never a good thing when it comes to cleaning service evaluation  The hotel is beautiful with detail tha makes you feel special We had booked a room with no window but the staff was kind enough to offer an upgrade to executive room at no adictional cost The bed is very confortable with nice view of the river and the hotel is located in safe and beautiful spot in London 15 minutes of Canary Wharf tube station 
 A little outdated and bathroom not that great Maintenance needs to be better kept too  Perfect location overall the hotel looked lovely and rooms were nice and comfortable Good for the price Hotel was easy enough to get to too 
 Room was extremely noisy from lots of clanking from steam pipes presumably DLR was shut all weekend causing long walks or long waits for Bus  Location
 Came back from the theatre to eat at one of the restaurant s that was opened till 1am wasn t happy that you couldn t eat in the restaurant but had a choice of eating in the hotel lounge or take it to the room We took the food to the room and it was delicious would recommend the Italian but the hotel should tell you when the restaurant closes rather than advertising it till 1am  Hotel was a bit dated but added to its character very comfortable and clean Checked in and room was updated to one with a window staff very helpful good choice of breakfast Easy to get to from tube station Would stay again 
 Dirty vents and sink in the bath  I really like the location of the hotel and the view from my room Big rooms and comfy beds The hotel is nice and there are restaurant and pizza and nice lobby 
 The pizzeria restaurant had the worst pizzas I wasn t happy paying 30 and only did so because I was so hungry Not fresh at all and very oily Poor quality Was very disappointed as we d been looking forward to eating pizza all day Could maybe clean windows and revolving doors more often They were filthy  The room was a good size Very very clean Really comfortable bed The cocktails at the bar were amazing Nice and strong and worth 8 Would definitely stay here again
 Old hotel desperately needs an upgrade Other than the prices would not go again Rooms are worn out  Location and price was good Room had a weird smell so we got instantly upgraded to a suite with balcony 
 Shower toilet paper size or the double bed to small No good ahd in the room The shower was terrible it was burning water couldn t adjust the water to a comfortable temperature the air was terrible no good I couldn t sleep like that and toilet paper was awful very harsh glad they supplied a tissues box 
 All mirrors and glass in the main areas needed a good clean Breakfast was nothing special but ok for the price  Bed was superb and the room was very spacious good location 
 I was really surprised that in the era of internet I have to pay additionally to have connection in my room this was the biggest disadvantage especially if you travel for business If I knew this before booking I probably wouldn t choose this hotel Second thing breakfast not the best one typical British one while in International hotel you would expect more options to choose from  Localization was perfect for me since I went there in business Room was comfortable and coffee tea facility useful but poorly equipped 
 The receiptionist was unhelpful and very lazy Whatever I asked him he just stare at me and say he doesn t know He didn t know whether the room comes with a window or not he didn t know why there were price differences He even didn t want to find out any information for me The room condition is ok but there is big cupboard in the room I don t know what is covered by the cupboard it make huge noises in the early morning around 5am Also please be aware this hotel only provide 20 minutes free wifi There was no signal on my phone when I was in the room  The location is great amenities are great Room is clean and newly refurbished 
 There were no vending machines The rooms are dirty as hell Bathroom was nasty with nasty looking markings on the toilet The room was often cold The receptionists were not bothered by any requests to have the room cleaned My stay was less than favorable I will not be returning to this property My earnings are worth some type of politeness and respect I will be filing a formal complaint  The room was filthy to polite The windows were dirty The shower head fell off continuously causing even the bathing a hastle The floor was dirty in the bathroom I asked the receptionist to have the nasty windows cleaned on the inside as I requested and paid extra pound for a smoking room The windows were filled with smoke resin The receptionists seemed not bothered by my request The view was the best however the window was so dirty that I could not see clearly thru the window I will be filing a formal complaint concerning my stay 
 The room could have been cleaned better what looked like spit or poo old stain by the side of the wall near bed and hair in the bath Such a pity as everything else was excellent  Staff at Reception and view from room 
 Pillows bloody awful resulted in hardly any sleep and the fact it states on the booking com there is free WiFi for 30 mins a day or if you trek to the reception area when I asked he had the audacity to say it states in very small print on the site it is only free for a short time then a ridiculous amount thereafter Rooms were a bit tired looking more akin to a 1980 s Travel Lodge Glasses left in corridor for two days overall not impressed  The facilities in the hotel were OK with a traditional Italian Pizza and Indian restaurants in the building so good choice of eateries if you dont want to go out and staff were freindly
No Negative Lovely helpful staff Got upgraded for free as they had extra rooms Rooms were clean and tidy staff were helpful with train travel information Lovely comfortable seating sofa area looking out over Thames and close to the bar Would definitely stay here again 
 Not very nice stuff the room was just awful and no one helps us Too much time waiting we have to pay for the pool the room has some problems Just awful No Positive
 Room cold unstable to adjust heat without noise No batteries in tv remote Bed not very comfortable Changed room at booking in to a room with window no charge Spa bath in bathroom
 The use of the pool to come in with the price of hotel Also towels to be supplied at the pool Free breakfast if booking for 2 nights not just if booking for 1 night Didn t understand why if you spent more money for 2 nights you got nothing But one night you got a free breakfast  Liked that it was near a few restaurants and the 02 arena Liked the outside of hotel and the lobby area Rooms were clean and warm which was needed at this time of year 
 there is a train next to the hotel ask for room facing the other way don t bother with two beds in standard room they are next to each other and it s not possible to separate  3th replacement room we got was great finally 
 On arrival receptionist was trying to get me tonpay 80 for a room with windows only to find our room had windows anyway Pushy Swimming pool changing rooms horrible and pool needed painting  I liked the location Room very clean 
 We ate in the pizzeria in the hotel I had a jacket potato it was brown in side when I pointed this out they said it was fresh cooked the day before They didn t offer to change it or take it off the bill I had to argue with the duty manager The room was 29 degrees we asked to lower the temperature but all they did was open a window we could not sleep in such a stuffy hot room Close to the o2
 Building works and moved to room that overlooked them But at least the work stopped at 7pm on the Friday night and didn t happen over weekend Location location location
 The entrance is quite grand but when you go to the room it s very dated Beds are not that comfortable I prefer the premier inn beds I liked the pool facilities
 Dated decor slightly scruffy Could feel the springs in the mattress of executive suite Weird groups of men in the pool sauna staring at us and noisy children who appeared to be visiting the pool only not guests at the hostel Changing rooms cold showers blocked with hair not clean Communal area spacious and comfy but cold due to big windows Cocktails poorly made essentially a pint of pineapple juice with 1 shot of rum Room service prompt but quality of food poor pizza terrible  Nice breakfast Good location right by the water Friendly staff
 The room looked tired it needed redecorating peeling wallpaper stains on the wall Even though we only paid 65 00 you would expect a certain standard of room this unfortunately was hot meet I am sorry to be so negative but it was just not up to standard Trays in the corridor when I went up to my room initially and they were still there the next day  The location the staff the upgrade to a room with a window the price 
 The worst hotel I have ever experienced in my life the room the spa the food quite unbelievable that a hotel like this can stay open the owners should be ashamed of themselves No Positive
 You couldn t control the air con in the room We only had one blanket and I really feel the cold so was freezing in the middle of the night The hotel is really tired and needs a facelift They charge for using the pool which is not mentioned when booking The pool is very average and the spa was like warm No Positive
 The un sympathetic staff The Window with a view of a steel wall literally The four single beds The noise from the elevators and work going on outside To far from tube station  Nothing
 The room looked like something from 1982 and pretty depressing for a single traveller Most things had obvious signs of wear and tear Swimming pool was ok but needs complete overhaul Brunch was poor with silver foil in scrambled eggs burnt tomatoes and no tea served you even have to do that yourself  This hotel needs a complete refurbishment
 Room was constantly at 29 degrees and couldn t be changed and the overground directly outside kept us awake for two nights ending at 1 am and beginning at 5am Stains on the towels which weren t changed either Moved room for the third night this was slightly better except for the external air con machines  Location for travelling around London but keeping away from the madness of central London 
 Limited WiFi access Limited refreshments in room ok if you drink caffinated coffee and tea with milk Room felt dated and a little tired Location is outstanding
 The staff are never smiling it s as though the customers are an inconvenience to them Instance I walked into breakfast at 7am the guy at the door said Voucher card no good morning no please certainly no thank you All of the staff that you see around the hotel never say hello can I help they just look straight through you Customer service is extremely poor sorry  Great location fabulous view from my room
 Staff at breakfast should be trained to ask guests if they had stayed before and if not explain the way in which things are done Jugs on tables have very strong stewed coffee in them took me 5 minutes to find out Tea you go to collect Breakfast is self service but not easy to negotiate Best to put amount of coffee in cup the go up and find hot milk earn to blend it  From check in to check out a very friendly professional service by most staff Pizza excellent Breakfast very good 
 The staff We called the hotel ahead of our arrival to ask if there was parking We were told their was What we wasn t told was it was 42 So upon arrival we were met with a 42 parking fee in a non secure car park We tried to speak to the duty manager who was absurdly rude He spoke to us with no respect and told us if we didn t like the parking cost we could leave We were in complete shock He was so rude We are very well travelled and have never encountered such rudeness We also found the rooms dirty Hairs in the bed Wall paper hanging off Unkept carpet Now for the grand finally Rats There were 2 rats that we saw on separate occasions and in different parts of the hotel My advice avoid this pit of a hotel  The location was wonderful 
 The water was not that hot At breakfast it was the same water for tea and coffee lukewarm I was on the first floor and my room had no windows I thought I would not like it and was thinking of upgrading but it was spacious the room was big so was the barthroom I loved it
 The heating was not on and we had to ask for it to be put on and sleeping nearer to the Water it was quite cold for February Parties by other occupants at 3am  The Full English Breakfast was excellent and eat as much as you want for 14 approx per person Great varierty The bedroom were clean 
 That I had to check out of the hotel the next morning I didn t want to leave the place if I had to be really honest  I was pleasantly surprised to walk into my room with window view and it was bigger then what I had thought so was very happy so for those very reasons I couldn t of highlighted anything bad after that 
 Even though big the room was stuffy as the windows didn t open Light came through the window all night and the bed was not comfortable I usually really enjoy a hotel cooked breakfast but this was one of the worst I ve had  Big room with space and chairs to relax 
 There was nothing I did not like apart from having to leave the hotel when my business trip was over  I loved the balcony overlooking the canal locks totally unexpected The room was great and breakfast was included and very good The trains are very local and the shops bars and restaurants nearby plentiful and good value 
 Rooms are dated Needs some serious modernisation The wall paper was ripped in some places the carpet was worn out not a place I would stay again 24 hour parking was expensive The star rating should be reviewed as its not up to 4 star standard  On site parking
 Found hair in my bath that was quite clearly not mine Bath should have been cleaned properly Wardrobe doors were precarious to say the least so I did not use it for fear of them falling out of the frame D cor was out dated and tied lots of road noise from the street below and I was on the 10th floor  Can t think of anything oh yes the beer was reasonably priced 
 The room was big and the heater provided wasn t enough to heat up the room so it was very cold I loved the balcony it was great to be able to have a comfortable room with fresh air 
 Definitely not a 4 star We stayed in the delux double and yet no staff to help with bags uncomfortable beds hard pillows dirty walls 1 ply toilet paper 5 tray charge for room service staff not helpful on a construction site so very noisy Would not stay there again No Positive
 The hotel is absolutely HORRIBLE If you are travelling on your own and like the company of the Norfolk Howard or a few alongside with mice in the dining area this is the place for you Tried to speak to the staff and the hotel manager who just laughed in my face and said to carry investigation on the bed bugs we will have to charge you 350 00 So if you fancy some extreme  There is only one thing to like about this hotel location 
 Staff member made me wait 10 minutes whilst he did the paperwork from a previous guest at 3am No hot water from the bathroom taps or shower Noisy room by double doors so you can hear slamming through the night The rooms need sound proofing can hear neighbours talking clearly  It was clean 
 This hotel would have been really nice about 15 years ago Sadly its suffering from urban decay and is in dire need of investment it s by no means bad its just looking abit tired and needs serious amounts of investment However it being a Britannia it will ran into the ground and then sold to a developer however the price was reflective of the above For what I paid 60 I would 100 stay again  Very good price and great location Friendly Staff Offers excellent value given the location 
 I didn t like my room because it was cold and the bed was too small for a double when I requested for room move they put me in a twin disable room when I clearly booked a double when I requested for another room move they said they were gonna ring me back which they never did So I had to go back downstairs to speak to someone They were rude and put me back to the same room I said I didn t like  Nothing to be honest
 It was quite cold in the room and the blanket too thin and small for a big double bed Also no wifi in the room just the lobby  Awesome location and a very spacious room for London standards 
 The bed really wasn t very comfortable and our bathroom had a sink without a working tap  Location was decent and the hotel feels very grand on entering the building 
 The staff are not very helpful or polite The rooms could do with a face lift and nip and tuck here are there  The height of the bed plus to the size as it very spacious with a lot of room for movement Bed is also very comfy with a great view out of the window over looking canary wharf
 The hotel was worn out and old Wasn t at all like the pictures in booking com My room had furniture that was older than me and I am 45  Shower was high powered The main bar was nice
 I asked for poached eggs to the chef who told me to ask the waiter I did and pointed to were I was sitting half an hour later ni eggs I asked the chef and he insisted on showing they were ready in the kitchen I never received the eggs and as I had to leave for my meeting was very disappointed To be fair most of the staff were very good but the kitchen staff we please read
 As i travelled by car to the hotel I felt like it took alot longer then the hour and some min from Heathrow it was gonna take I really liked the location of the hotel i would also advise people traveling to this hotel if you don t have kids take the underground it doesn t make you feel like you are going in circles
 Outdated Felt like a shabby seaside hotel Appalled that only 40mins of free wifi is given Rooms terribly outdated and wallpaper peeling Window closing mechanism was broken to window bolted shut but allowed in a lot of street Will not be staying again  Staff were all very friendly and service was good 
 The Italian restaurant could serve something more fresh it was a bit like a takeway food pizza reminded me of Dominos although some might like it But the prices were good so can t complain  We had an amazing view through the window I liked the old British interior 
 I was thrown of the hotel at 11pm at night My partner who was working in the area had booked a room and he was stopped by the manager and a police officer who insisted we leave the hotel no refund was given and its disgusting how we was thrown out on the street at 11pm at night Will be taking further action on this  Nothing please avoid this hotel at all costs 
 Couldn t open windows no fresh air The professional way in which the staff dealt with my discrepcy regarding the room and the quietness of the hotel
 No downfalls though all was good Reception staff were great and very welcoming even upgraded our room for us as have stayed before Rooms are great size and very comfy beds Great location
 Poor WiFi provision  Large lounge area with comfortable chairs and plenty of space to sit quietly Small lounge bar stays open late I was upgraded from the room type I originally booked Quick reception service 
 We stayed in a non smoking room and the room smelt of cigarettes someone was going to come up and freshen up the room no one came to do this and we was not offered another room The state of the room needs updating as there is allot of rust in the bath rooms this is not worth 115 per night The executive suit is just two double beds pushed together No Positive
 Breakfast is a joke you have to wait 10 to 30 mns Lifts are in the mornings blocked for several minutes aswell My room had NO window I know now how prison feels Value for money is very bad 200 GBP per night Taxis are more expensive if the concierge calls them He asks them for a commission 2 taxi driver told me this when I asked He adds minimum 5 GBP up to 20 GBP for airport transfer By the way My room had a terrible smell The reason could be that there is no window so NO fresh air at all  Restaurant staff is friendly and location is good Lobby is like a pub with many british guests who drink a lot I think nothing for families with kids but good to meet peeple if you travel alone 
 Room stank of smoke Towels could not be used because of smoke smell Furniture in the room is very dated Bathroom fittings are poor  Room was spacious 
 Due to mechanical problems no hot food when got back to hotel and nothing open around the immediate area Had 2 lots sandwich of 2 rounds of white bread few crisps and lettuce leaf With a bottle of water 16 85  Friendly staff
 Wifi should be free of cost and 24 hours nonstop to all rooms rather than just 20mins free service per room per day View point of Canary Wharf from window and balcony
 Breakfast was cold and had been left out for a while no fresh batches were brought out The croissants were even tough The bed mattress was so hard it was uncomfortable to sleep on On the day of departure we were refused entrance to the gym and pool apparently even guests have to pay to use these on top of what you pay to stay the night I have never stayed in a hotel where you cannot use the facilities There was no confirmation of this on our booking nor did anyone inform us when we checked in Although the location is good only 10 minute walk to Canary Wharf the view from the room is just of a building site From the moment we arrived the sound of drills were evident No Positive
 The comfort of the bed the room service the breakfast prices and there could have been a shower I loved the fact that you could leave your bags there for free all day on the final day and come in whenever you want
 The cleaniness of the room was not good Other guests hairs in bath and sink Yuk Also decor is very dated and needs a refresh Breakfast was disgusting and you could tell they were using cheap food meat  Cost was not bad price
 Tiny sized bed  An easily accessible hotel away from the hustle and bustle of central London Friendly staff Restaurants in the hotel so no need to leave which I enjoyed after a long days walking Bar next to the Thames to relaxin the evening I enjoyed my stay 
 The hotel was very cold Reception area lounge and bar area so cold that it was uncomfortable to sit in the space Which is a shame as it was a lovely space but FREEZING When we first arrived our room was also cold but the heating seemed to kick in and it warmed up eventually The breakfast wasn t hot enough and very substandard for 13  Very friendly and helpful staff We were upgraded which was lovely Receptionist were particularly friend and smiley 
 Breakfast finished st 10 30 on Saturday so went at 10 to find most items on the buffet hadn t been replenished and what was there looked very unappetising Asked if we could have poached eggs and were told that the kitchen had closed After asking if the hot trays would be refilled someone came out within minutes with a tray of very overcooked looking sausages at which point we decided to leave and ask for our breakfast payment to be refunded Manager not accommodating and refused to refund us We checked out and walked 5 minutes to Carluccio s and had an amazing breakfast freshly cooked with excellent produce My advice Don t pay extra for breakfast at this hotel plenty of choice within very close walking distance and cheaper too  Brilliant Consierge nice outlook over the water 
 I was given a room which Was occupied But the receptionist resolve this promptly Dana the receptionist Remember me from my last visit She delt with my room issue promptly And professional
 The furnishings and decor of the standard double room with windows looked tired and the room could do with a make over because the dark wood furniture with scratches and blue striped wallpaper with marks on it isn t very appealing The bathroom needs an upgrade the mirrors show signs of age one them was going brown along the sides and the chrome mirror finish was affected The air con didn t cool the room and when switched on the non smoking room then had faint smelt of cigarettes Location is near the DLR and the train noise could be heard We could also hear the people in the room next door talking and taking part in erm well things you do in bed at night that make the bed knock against the wall  Friendly and helpful staff A decent warm shower A good choice for breakfast An ideal location for The O2 Arena 
 There was a fly in my pasta One staff at the hotel was rude and even wanted to charge us 5 for asking to have a cover to carry our food to our room We later spotted a mouse running round the waiting area The salmon pasta smelt foul The room took ages to clean and we had to ask for sheets to change it ourselves The heater in the room does not work Just hated the whole experience in this hotel  The location view and concierge 
 The bed a little uncomfortable as it was 2 beds joined together and the middle line was hurting my back The size of the room was amazing The pictures does not do it justice at all 
 They would not serve us breakfast because we went down at 10 30 and they stop serving at 10 30 Does this mean if we went down at 10 29 we would be able to eat then  The staff at the front desk gave us free upgrade to a window room 
 The bed was really uncomfortable and the furniture was really old fashioned  The staff was very friendly and the location was very good close to the tube and supermarkets 
 although I booked a smoking room the smell of smoke in the room was overwhelming may be the rooms need to be aired longer saw a mouse in the bar speedy check in
 I loved everytning Booking com didnt do my confirmation properly so they didnt have it on their system but they managed to sort me out with something even better
 Air con constantly on in room was cold on first night did offer another room but had to pay 30 extra  Location and size of room good breakfast nice and spa facilities good enjoyed my 2nights stay would recommend 
 All the extras WiFi 7 pounds a day room service 5 pounds extra taxis a rip off late checkout 10 pounds by the hour You feel kind you re getting fleaced for everything Staff seem pretty miserable and most of the guests too  Flexibility and ease of booking
 Customer service was very disappointing the manager in charge Mr Ruben has a very negative approach I will never recommend any body to spend a night there whenever he is on duty No Positive
 The price on booking com fornt page and the price on the email recieved was different I emailed bookinng com witha proof but they didnt get back to me and had to pay to pay more at the hoetel Not the hotel s fault though Its en error with booking com I am still waiting for an answer since last week  The staff were really helpfull 
 The whole experience and then being over charged for said experience  HAd to pay an extra 21 pound for wifi in the room Water was cold having a shower reception staff were extremely rude paid extra for a view of the river but it was view of a loud building site 
 No hot water Had to move room four times Was allocated a room that had already been allocated to another traveller who hammered on my door and was cross that I was in his room Was offered a meal via room service I thought this was compensation but then was made to pay 16 for a very bad pizza Nice rooms
 The bed was 2 single beds pushed together the room was freezing and the staff on checking out were not friendly he never asked did I enjoy the stay or was all o k when I asked for my 50 pound deposit n leaving they made me wait while they checked my room No Positive
 Horrific weekend Persuaded to upgrade when we arrived our upgraded room was over looking a building site not the river as assured We were unable to notice this when we initially went to the room as it was dark However at 6am the DLR started and then at 7am the building works started When we asked to speak to duty manager he was busy so waited when he finally came to talk to us it was apparent he had been busy having a cigarette We delayed speaking to anyone as I just wanted to get out of the hotel in the morning and try and enjoy the weekend so spoke upon our return early evening to which he told me I should have complained earlier We were eventually moved however to a smaller room despite paying upgrade When we went to our room to pack up our luggage before moving it was clear housekeeping hadn t cleaned anything just poorly made a bed In general the hotel was run down and in the middle of a building site A Gin and tonic is served in a half pint glass Lift glass is shattered and both rooms we had were freezing when we first entered as the heating is off until u go in  Unfortunately no
 The furniture is very old and Te bed was not so comfortable rusty in the bathroom I had staff walk into my room when I was there and another staff knock as they wanted to clear the room at 9am before I checked out It was a nuisance They should know who has checked out instead of knocking doors and opening doors  The price was reasonable stuff was lovely
 I asked for a large wine and was told I could only have medium I saw a large wine glass waiting to be washed right next to me as I was told they had no glasses This was on a Saturday night  Excellent location and a lovely bar area where you can relax right next to the water 
 The bed was as hard as a rock the aircon does not work in the room even though we were non smoking smoke was coming through the vent in the bathroom shower was bad the walls are so thin you can hear the couple next door a queue for breakfast in the morning paying 4 pounds to use gym towels had marks on them I will never go back again  The staff were friendly and check in was fine and that is about that 
 You only get 20 min free wifi Staff are disinterested Italian restaurant was cold service was poor they looked bored Reception check in staff ignored me for ages while she messed about with some more important paperwork staplers Leave plenty of time for checkout You can t have a vat receipt upon payment at check in so everyone was queuing for them in the morning  Good business location 5 min walk from the DLR station Comfortable beds Bathrooms room decor is outdated but clean 2 average restaurants to choose from if you don t feel like venturing out 
 The room was very closed horrible art work no toothpaste the swimming pool shower didn t last long the sunbeds looked grimey no gluten free expensive breakfast outside of building looks ugly and it s difficult to get to Bed was comfy character of hotel was beautiful relaxing stay
 The towels are far too small the sheets did not fit the beds and although we have stayed at this hotel many times it was just too noisy so will find another hotel in future  The location was perfect 
 Location was poor the hotel is looking very tiered the staff were far from helpful it was very noisy and cold I think the later is probably due to the single glazing  There was nothing I liked about this hotel 
 We were not given the correct information about the car park when we rang the hotel several times before our journey The coffee was cold so we only drank tea No Positive
 Nothing particular  Location location and great value for the price Ok the hotel is not new but has everything you need for a stay in London If you want spectacular hotel than you ll have to pay for it not expect to have a Plaza stay for Britannia price 
 Liked everything Pool and a nice three coarse in pizzeria restaurant staff friendly accomadate you as much as they can looking forward to going bAck for Christmas
 it does not make sense that WIFI and swimming pool cost extra The double bed is joined two single beds which means there is an unpleasant gap in the middle the train and building construction noise from outside is soooo loud  staff was friendly 
 Excell We loved the style of the room with regency styled furniture The staff were also very helpful and polite The food was also to an excellent standard I would recommend staying at the Britannia international to a friend and consider staying there myself in the near future 
 I booked in a couple of weeks ago and was asked if would like to upgrade free of charge This time I was asked if I would like to upgrade at a cost Location and standard of rooms
 Well my room had no window and no alarm clock and no way to let air out so after a hot shower I went to sleep and because the heating was on and no window or alarm clock I m used to waiting yo to light from a window so I over slept and no clock so I didn t know was time it was so I kept going back to sleep when it was last 10 I asked for my breakfast they said no because I woke up late but if there where windows or a clock I would kno what time of day it was Also jacuzzi was offNo Positive
 Staff mistakenly charged my bill and I am still waiting for their refund Booking com has been in contact with them for this matter Really appreciate Booking com s assistance The lift in the hotel is very old and slowly And it s very shaky and quite terrifying Bed is ok standard and comfort But the air con is so loud that we had to switch off while sleep Swimming pool receptionist is very nice person but not smart enough and apparently lack of experiences of good customer service More training needed  Restaurant is good Italian Restaurant staff very helpful and friendly Food portion is huge and so worthy on the price 
No Negative Everything was wonderful nothing seemed to much trouble for the staff who were working in the hotel Our check in lady was a real credit to the hotel so helpful and always had a smile on her face
 Pool and jaccuzi were a little too cold hard to set a good temp in the shower no free Wi Fi Amazing scenery around all of canary warf Nice esthetics in the Intel Nice room not too far from public transport
 No means of warming breakfast croissants Dirty windows Shabby external entrance and forecourt Turned away from Jennys Restaurant as too busy with coach parties Main bar closed or used for private function Cold in Jennys restaurant at breakfast times although efforts were made to heat it up with a portable gas blower Bathroom dated and shabby  Comfortable and good views from rooms overlooking river Good hearty breakfast 
 the bed mattress was old and uncomfortable and needs replaced the room got cold between 4am and 8am and not enough extra blankets for bed the breakfast was really bad the english fry up was the worse i ve ever tasted and i ve worked all over britain and tasted a fair few No Positive
 The wifi was over priced and slow as hell The breakfast was cold and soggy  Loved everything rhe sights the staff the facilities all really pleasurable
No Negative Typical Britannia decor and fittings circa 1992 but if you like a bit of retro really quite nice Fantastic location if you are working in Canary Wharf or holidaying in Millwall Nice feel to the hotel as you walk in warm and friendly reception staff who give you a little upgrade when it s quiet and a large and comfy bedroom If you can get one of their cheaper deals what more could you ask for 
 The 20 mins free wi fi in the room It should be all free Most places you go its free wi fi It was in the perfect location for getting in and out of London staff were very helpful and friendly food and drink wasn t over priced
 They need a machine for essentials such as toothpastes etc Also need more tea in rooms or biscuits and more comfort  The location and generally is a lovely hotel
 Room was cold Shower had a hair trigger I e Cold or scolding For this price breakfast should be included fixtures and fittings in rooms look tired and require refurbishmentNo Positive
 Noisy due to construction word and DLR nearby Room a little shabby cables exposed to TV cracked wash basin in en en suite carpet fraying in places Dated wallcovering Didn t realise booking was for room without windows when reserving Would regard hotel as 3 star at best Spacious room albeit odd shape Good views
 Plug in the bathroom sink did not work and the kettle you had to hold the button down and wait for it to boil otherwise as soon as you let go it stopped boiling Room was very cold No Positive
 Unfriendly and not collaborative personnel Any request is answered with No sorry or Contact the customer support per email My suggestion try some other hotel No Positive
 The bed was rather hard but ok The breakfast had rather small variety of selections and the breakfast room was icy cold  Was allowed to change room when the first room turned out to be extremely noisy due to construction work just outside Next room was better since it had A C and was on a higher floor so that the construction noise still outside the window wasn t a problem 
 My first room I was offered but the receptionist sorted it out straight away The receptionist she was very organised Resolved my problem straight away
 Very long waits at reception Hard pillows The continuous sound of the aircon fan  Good position for access to ravel links and sightseeing Clean room Excellent value for money 
 Wifi as mentioned Very helpful staff but to get wifi in your room for 24 hours is 7 and this only works on one device so if travelling for business with laptop and phone devices can get caught out here paid wifi should be for more than one device Other than that well priced and comfortable stay 
 Could of made the rooms more Modern and added some colour Better pictures and furniture Bed was lovely and comftorbale Food was excellent and a few restaurants within the hotel Room was spacious and the view out the windows were amazing 
 My daughter son in law and granddaughter had to stay in a smoking room and they are smokers because they didn t have our request for an extra bed the smell was dreadful but nothing else we could do Rooms clean and tidy
 Breakfast was boring and bland A receptionist was talking to his friend while we were waiting for service from him I m stuck here at the moment you know It was not perhaps his favourite job but he seemed really unprofessional to me Staff in general was helpful when asked but they didn t really seem eager to please Seemed happy with the 4 stars although I ve been to smaller MUCH better 2 star hotels It felt like the hotel manager had been away from 6 months  Was cheap and in a good part of the city there was no garbage anywhere 
 WifI 20 mins free then you have to pay Most places are free these days  My room was amazing As a lone female traveller I also felt comfortable dining alone 
 Customer service was appalling some members of staff were rude and antagonistic which seriously needs to be addressed The hotel looked dated and in need of updating Definitely not a four star hotel  Nothing
 Would have liked a room with the balcony like last time as you cant open the window and it did get abit stuffy Claustrophobic  I would have preferred the room with the balcony like last time but i cant complain Good Hospitable gentleman at the front desk despite arriving at 1 30am in the morning XD
 Breakfast meal was good but breakfast standards are very low Table set ups lay up of the buffet clearing troleys with dirty plates cups e t c inside the breakfast room so guests could see all of it whilst eating not good enough  Nice and clean room very comfortable bed Close distance to Canary Wharf tube station Very good value 
 Shower was more likely cold than hot but everybody is different  Location and staff was really good for money Breakfast worth adding for extra 10 per person
 Duvet Pillows Bed all very uncomfortable Room too hot noise from DLR They charge for WiFi and use of the gym Rooms very shabby and dated  Nothing except location 
 The bed was nice and big however it was 2 mattresses put together and quite uncomfortable for a couple to sleep on If I wanted to sleep in a separate bed I would have booked a twin The parking I said was a bonus has an extremely cunning system They have an overnight rate of 15 but the catch is you have to leave the car park by 9am The luxury of parking your car until checkout which is only 2 hours later will cost you an extra 6 which I thought was a little excessive  The hotel room was lovely and spacious and the view was beautiful The bar sits on the river and is extremely tranquil It s a bonus that they have parking and the staff are very pleasant and polite 
 electric was not working and party in next room all night not good at all i am still waiting on response from my complaint from when I stayed previous week No Positive
 I had no problems and overall there was nothing I did not like which surprised me as there is usually something  Friendly staff in bar concierge and room service
 Did not book breakfast thought it was too expensive able to buy good food very near the hotel Need juice and small snacks or fruit in the room maybe on arrival  Really large room we were given free upgrade when we arrived Very good location 5 10 mins walk from Canary walk Comfortable beds Cleaned every day Lots of Eating places on the doorstep beautiful entrance and Christmas decorations were better than the Hilton my daughter was staying in and the room was bigger 
 Have to pay for wifi pay for breakfast pay for later check out pay for water for the room there is no surprise and delight you feel that you are just being milked all of the time There is a lot of building work going on so it s not easy to find a way to go over the bridge to Canary Wharf any more  I was upgraded to a room with a conference table in it 
 A noisy location due to road and rail noise There is a huge construction site directly next door which has recently begun This will be under construction for the next couple of years The rooms are dated and in need of full renovation The gym was filthy with dirty walls It was damp and the changing rooms were dire The shower cubicle doors were off their hinges This place needs condemning Never again And a case of another hotel ripping guests off by charging for Wi Fi in 2017 for goodness sake  Nothing other than the helpful concierge when I needed to leave collect my luggage 
 Confusion on wifi Excellent location and ambience There was confusion on WiFi It was mentioned as paid so I have not used it But actuslly it was free 
 They charge extra for everything from wifi to early check in to car park to breakfast I think they charge for the pool too so the price is not representative given what you end up paying Also there was a power cut just effecting the hotel meaning I had to get dressed in the dark have a cold shower go to a business meeting with my hair wet and not be able to make a drink I asked for compensation or a refund and they just didn t bother replying No Positive
 Accommodation seemed very tired out of date id not take the breakfast option wasn t good value for money  Location very handy for links into London
 The staff were horrible the room was dirty including the bathroom I complained but I was downgraded to a smaller room no refund  Horrible Sirloin steak with peppercorn sauce which I paid extra for including 5 for a room service
 One member of staff on reception didn t seem interested in helping us out once we were booked in But the girl who booked us in when we arrived was very nice The shower wasn t very hot but it was ok for a quick turnaround The breakfast wasn t as good as I expected The overall setup needs looking at  Overall the hotel was in great condition Would stay there again if the was another offer on at the time 
 Manager was awful disrespectful and not helpful to numerous customers A lot of people booked double rooms and were given two twin beds even after complaints They tell you to push them together but my room had a pillar in the middle so that was impossible  Cleaning staff were kind and helpful Concierge and reception were too 
 no hot water on the saturday evening for a shower It s a lovely old building but in need of some TLC in house maintenance Parking a bit expensive by comparison staff and location were excellent very good selection for breakfast Easy to drive to with parking
 Hot water was too hot difficult to get a temperate stream for my morning shower  Spacious rooms comfortable bed above average TV screen for a hotel room quiet 
 Charge for swimming pool Air con didn t work but did not bother us much I had a free upgrade which was a fantastic view of the jp Morgan building 
 The receptionist wasn t particularly welcoming and was very stern didn t smile However got past that My main disappointment throughout my stay was there was a huge building sight right outside my window which started making loud noises from as early as 5am Which I hadn t been told about when I checked in had i of known this I would of purchased a room with no window or on the other side of the building so I actually got some sleep ready for my meeting early the following morning Also a member of staff opened my door at 7am and came in waking me up with no apology just quickly slamming the door behind him her Hopefully you can offer me something to compensate my not so good stay at your hotel I would really appreciate if this is a possibility  I liked the comfortable bed and the shower was powerful 
 No hot water was waiting all evening was told will be informed about the hot water when it is repaired noone bothered to call even after giving room number truly upsetting  It was clean
 The electricity cut out from the early hours of the morning staff couldn t give updates or say what happened Had to walk up and down the stairs from the 10th floor with heavy suitcases and no assistance Had to check out super early Paid for breakfast but didn t even get to eat due to the power cut Markings on the walls and room very dated  The room was upgraded due to our room not being ready and then for giving us the wrong type of room The staff are very friendly but a bit of a language barrier English is not perfect The 10th floor is very cosy and warm The showers are nice 
 beds a little hard sorry and issues with locating it as roadworks building works has closed the main road and were not informed when booked of another route parked nearby and walked as could see hotel and got directions from builders luckily located a space  everything else Decor lovely 
 woke up to no electric on the wednesday so no shower no lights no lift no breakfast no hot drink no heating and no care attitude from manager and staff very poor showNo Positive
No Negative Excellent Spa Sauna Good Tasty Reasonably Priced Food in the Hotels Italian Resteraunt Service with a smile Upgrade to room with window at avery good price Having spoken with my wife would definately stay over when visiting Theatreland or 02 etc Great find will be staying over again soon if within my company budget 
 there was a total power cut from 5am until i left at 8am There was no notification from staff like a note pushed under the doors so it was up to us to walk down to reception and ask the single member of staff what was going on i therefore had to shower and try to get ready using just a phone light When i asked for a refund i was told that the GM had said no refunds and so it was down to the reception staff to pass this message on The GM should have been there  great location and a good price
 Unfortunately a power cut meant that we paid 20 for a breakfast that comprised of crossiants and cereal There was nothing that could have been done but not gettting our money back for the breakfast was disappointing Several parts of the room window wardrobe door and drawers need maintaining as they were broken  Great value for money majority of staff very friendly Room was comfortable and clean 
 Windows were super dirty The gym is dirty the ceiling is so low you can t raise your arms and with bad and very old equipment Breakfast was bad Air the in the bedroom was unbreathable even after turning the heating off the temperature would not drop below 23 C No mini fridge  View and location
 The room was OK but clearly a bit worn in places Temp control on the wall could not make the room cool We asked the facilities management to look at this but they did not appear to understand how a thermostat worked the temp shown is the room temp sir If you open the window the temp will go down so they opened the window and the room did get cool 1 4 January on the 8th floor The thermostat on the wall appeared to be stuck at 27degrees The fan was a bit noisy and rattled the a c ducting However the DLR line is quite close so the noise from the trains was the price to pay for a cool room Not a big problem but I did get up first thing 06 00 ish to shut the window  Location superb as was the discounted rate for our three night stay Fine view across to the O2 Five minute walk to South Quay station making the journey from hotel to Oxford Circus about 30 mins via Bank Lots of choice in the restaurants and the bar prices were very reasonable indeed Parking was OK too at 21 per 24 hrs
 Just the fact we are stranded on a Sunday after midnight to get back Also the windows could do wuwith a ckean We really enjoyed staying so much we booked an extra night friendly staff comfortable The size of room really spacious views only thing we didn t like which was our own fault was Sunday 12am our day ticket ran out and we were stranded 80 taxi fare Spoilt the end of our trip But we will definitely be interested in any special offers monthly from January 27th onwards 100 happy Brtitania hotels are great 
 Change the mattresses We love the top floor rooms but the only down fall was the mattress on the bed had its springs poking This isn t the first time we experienced this as we use Britannia on a regular basis
 They gave a room with no window and the room was extremely small We had to pay an extra 20 to upgrade We could not use Jenny s restaurant due an event over new year The location
 It was a very cold room with timed heating so we needed to request for an additional heater to be out in the room It s fine because they sorted the issue out no problem The balcony
 This is an hotel from probably the 1970 s in an area of up to the moment architecture and modernity It is an anachronism It was dark dingy in places the rooms dust and grime windows so dirty hard to see through and especially bathroom old pubic hairs around bath and an ineffective shower were not particularly clean it lacks investment  Wi Fi was free and reasonably fast when the indications had been otherwise Breakfast was great Location ideal for Canary Wharf
 Surly staff who didn t understand problems wrong times in room info for spa a trek to the tube no cleaning of room over 2 days Big room on second attempt
 The fact I had to ask for the view I was told it was a river view it wasn t kind receptionist moved us Hard bed Room a bit shabby Jacuzzi didn t work  Great location and view Helpful staff 
 Not having the maid knock on our door before 8am would have been nice I was up and getting ready for work but this is still too early  I loved our balcony even though it was freezing cold we sat out and had a glass of wine We were greeted well by reception staff and check in was quick 
 Decor was very shabby and dated Carpet worn stains in room Very limited facilities such as tea coffee supplies etc Very overpowering smell of bleach in reception and lobby area  The staff were helpful and friendly 
 It s a little outdated compared to other more modern hotels none the less it still holds its class and facilities well I would definitely return for a stay mostly value for money Great value for a lovely located Canary Wharf hotel for NYE the best value for money I could find Upgraded to an executive room for free when asked for room with a view very happy customer I loved it
 The noise of others even after we contacted the reception team nothing was done unfortunately  The location and overall standard of hotel was good with easy access to parking at a cost
No Negative Room was dirty panell in the bathroom to cover spills wasn t there so all water fell on the door which becomes slippery was a hazard as had my 7 daughter
 The bathroom could do with an update as it looked very tired and well used and a bulb or two didnt work  We were upgraded upon arrival which was nice and the staff were very friendly and helpful 
 Double bed was two singles joined securely together but with a ridge in the middle 20 minutes free wifi then pay Non smoking room smelled of cigarettes Difficult to adjust shower temperature No in room safe  Good breakfast On site parking 20 for 24 hours Spacious room 
 The hotel looks tired and dull everywhere The bar chairs are mostly too low The room has wallpaper peeling off scratched furniture and carpet badly laid The beds were narrow and pretty basic Premier Inn much better in all respects except location on this occasion The clientelle is very much bottom end group tour package  Check in was cheerful and efficient Croissants were OK but nothing special The location suited our needs Food and service in the Pizzeria was good 
 Outdated rooms worn out NO free WiFi Just 20 min is free IT doesn t have the facilities of a 4 star hotel Everything is pretty much basic  Location nearby canary wharf shopping mall and tube station Hotel has a paid car park
 1 WIFI You need to pay 7 00 for WIFI usage in the room it s unacceptable when you pay at least 60 and above for the room There are many hotels which offer free WIFI in Lobby room The free wifi is only applicable in the hotel lobby 2 Location The hotel is located quite close to Canary Wharf tube station However there is a construction right next to the hotel Hence we are unable to use the nearest pathway to the hotel The construction is said to be done in 2020 You will now need about 10 minutes walking distance from the tube station to the hotel  The bed was really comfy Toilet is huge with a bathtub and basic amenities prepared shower cap body lotion body and hair shampoo There are 2 extra pillow prepared in the wardrobe too 
 The place looks tired and and could do with some TLC I m so glad we didn t get a standard room as booked  Was happy with our upgrade to a suite which may have made the booking to its actual value 
 There isn t anything I didn t like  Everything was just perfect from the room overlooking the water and sites of London facilities in the room staff and breakfast Definately will stay here again
 The heather did not work the tv didn t work and the bath bubbles did nt work and therefore I would expect something in return  The location was fine take the boat into the centre 
 The rooms were very old like they haven t been renovated in a while wifi is 7 pounds if you want to use it in the room and the soap dispenser in the shower was pretty much 90 water Bed was comfortable
 The greeting by reception staff on arrival could have been better  Room size was generous and we were upgraded as the type of room we had booked was not available 
 There s a lot of construction work around the area so we found the entrance a little tricky to find  Great views of Canary Wharf from our window Friendly and helpful staff Not modern decor but that s fine by us Easy to get the Tube 
 There was no central heating on in my room This was in December I complained to reception and a heater was eventually delivered The room never heated up properly over the 2 days I was bitterly disappointed No Positive
 Staff did not appear very happy Guy at breakfast reception was a total misery and could barely bring himself to speak to us Hotel is very tired Beds totally uncomfortable Worst thing of all was having to face a bowl of vomit yes vomit which was left on one floor by the lifts for two days and even after complaint to reception it was left there That s a first in any hotel ranking it as the worst hotel stay ever No price is worth what this place has to offer  Really nothing to like about the hotel itself Price was good for Canary Wharf though 
 The decor was extremely old and badly worn The room was clean but the double bed consisted of two very uncomfortable single mattresses put on a double base Very limited tea and coffee in the room we could have one cup of black tea and coffee each The shower over the bath was very difficult to regulate the temperature of the water The breakfast was supposed to be served until 10 30am We got to the breakfast room at 9 40am stood at the sign to be seated and staff just looked at us and carried on clearing tables I then approached a staff member and asked if we were just to sit anywhere and they smiled and said yes The breakfast was hot which was good but there were no cups available for tea and the glasses were very stained There is a view of the water but the windows are so dirty you can t actually see out It s a real shame as it could be a lovely hotel but I m under the impression that it s really neglected  The hotel room was clean
 The reception staff was extremely rude and could not speak English properly the staff made up a story that I used vulgar language which was a lie I then asked for the manager who corrected the situation This occurred the first time at reception on check in But the next day I was complaining about the bar staff attitude and again the staff made up a story that I used vulgar language The staff at this hotel clearly lie and accuse guests of things which are not true I will be taking these accusations up to the owners of the hotel The hotel was smelly with smoking smells They are a lot of hidden charges that was very surprising There is also no doorman you also have to pay for Wi Fi No Positive
 Pillows were very poor very uncomfortable Beds on the small side too Room comfort not the best  Gym check in and Location great Food was reasonable and good value 
 The hotel straddled the fence between vintage and dated The bed was two singles pushed together Very rowdy neighbours on my floor not the hotels fault obviously  Location was good great view great public transport Staff were generally helpful Booked a room with no window but nice suprise to be upgraded 
 Only eatable food for breakfast was toast bread Egg powder omelette without taste Some personnel was unpleasant on basic and normal questions not even a request Beds totally uncomfortable Mice olympics around midnight  Location is good Nice drink prices in Fridays caffe comparing it to London overall 
 This is our second stay at the hotel within the last 3 years However the hotel itself is starting to look tired and would benefit from a makeover Our room was disappointing in comparison to our first visit I think for the money you could do better  location is good breakfasts were pretty good too 
 Rooms have a very worn shabby feel and toiletry and tea coffee provisions were very basic Heating air conditioning appeared uncontrollable and we were extremely uncomfortable due to overheating Inability to open windows is a major disadvantage and for me resulted in poor night s sleep Breakfast was very poor not hot and the range of food very limited  The foyer restaurant and bar areas are spacious and attractive and the location of the hotel is good We enjoyed the view from our 9th floor room Staff were welcoming and friendly 
 There was building work going on around the hotel that started at 8am we were not happy getting woken up at that time And the male house keeping staff seemed to congregate just down the hall from our room they were intimidating and quite rude The room size was really good for london and for the price The hotel has a vintage feel a nice change to the sterile feel of some hotels 
 I had no window and no air conditioning and it was hot I wasnt told that I wouldnt have either and the hotel was full  The location and hotel genrally
 The fact that you can t pay over the phone and in spite of the UK regulatuon the hotel is asking customers to send their credit card details by email Because i could not pay for the hotel on bookong com or over the phone at the hotel for mu guests they refused to check in my guests and sent out my guests at 11pm to change eur into gbp and asked them to pay for the hotel Shame on you  Facilities location
 The hotel is quite noisy My room was on the side from the DLR Furthermore the curtains did not allow to properly darken the room from the outside Too much light No Positive
 I did not like the stink of cigarettes throughout the hotel including the bedroom floors My bedroom didn t smell but everywhere else I found stank of either stale or fresh cigarettes Breakfast should be included at the price you are charging Also I was annoyed that I had to pay for WIFI As I had to stay for 3 nights a small built in fridge would have been useful for me to keep some food drinks I also think not being able to leave any personal items in a hotel room is worrying There was a card on the table advising your guests not to leave anything valuable in the room In order for you to print these cards distribute them in every room means items must be going walkies on a regular basis That was a little concerning Every day I had to bring my laptop kindle phone charger to work with me  I had a basic room and you get what you pay for but the room covered all my basic needs My room was quiet which was great The room was cleaned well The iron and hairdryer were used worked and appreciated Staff were friendly and helpful Considering where the hotel is located the price was not too bad but you do have to pay for all add ons i e Wi Fi breakfast
 Weekend staff took 30 minutes to attend to us to check us in on arrival They were unfriendly and dismissive Didn t answer phone despite repeated attempts and took three calls and an hour to respond to replace a missing hairdryer Toilet was unflushed when we arrived and whole room smelt We were in a non smoking room but the whole floor stunk of smoke Not a good experience No Positive
 Can definitely do with some modern renovation in the rooms I like the traditional English look in the lobby and reception but rooms beds wallpaper TVs need an uplift It was very nice 5 7 mins to Canary Wharf station and Tesco and subway just up the road I had a problem with my room the staff immediately helped out and provided me with a better room 
No Negative amazing location amazing hotel for such a low price we couldn t believe it we were more than happy about this great hotel that was in a great neighbourhood and so close to city center and London east brick lane shoreditch co 
 The room without windows was quite claustrophobic and small it was also not very warm I was also not really happy at checking to have to pre authorise my card for a room I d already paid for the reason given was that a check on the correct card was needed  The hotel is very well situated for my requirements
 I have booked a smoking room in advance and when I arrived in the hotel they just told there s no any available smoking room so I was in the 10th floor and i had to go downstairs to smoke in the cold Need to pay for the swimming pool I though was a 4 star hotel and no free wifi in the room in the business district this is unacceptable  room was spacious location is excellent room service very good and fast I had a really good sirloin steak Breakfast is good
 On arrival we were advised by the concierge staff that our upgrade would be worth paying for as it had a very special view On paying the upgrade we outlooked a loud building site and the busy DLR railway We now wish we had stayed with our original room  The location for the O2 arena
 Maybe a few more teabags and or coffee sachets in room would have been nice  Very courteous staff good choice of breakfast menu Lovely Italian food available 
 Bed to small very uncomfortable Room unappealing Furniture drab and old Bathroom door dirty Curtains dated Could really do with decorating or a refurb Sofas in bar and reception area extremely low Anyone with mobility or of older years would struggle to sit down and get up I know I did Feels like you are sitting on floor Brass handrails on entrance and doors was filthy More cleaning needed Have stayed in many hotels but was disappointed at this one No Positive
 Tried to charge us 130 more than the price we had secured online Luckily I could get a screenshot sent over to my phone from home of the booking confirmation to show the front desk as evidence of the price secured Location very good for tram links
No Negative I booked a room with no window as advertised to keep cost down and was offered a free upgrade Read quite a few reviews about poor slow service however did not experience this The service was friendly 
 I had no problems with the hotel  I enjoyed the hotel room I thought the place was very clean professional looking I enjoyed the atmosphere of the hotel the staff were welcoming and friendly 
 POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE I fell over outside the hotel and when my husband asked for a first sis kit the staff ignored him and carried on serving How rude Room was constantly baking no way of turning down Headboard part fell off and exposed two long screws Bed very uncomfortable Overpriced and very tired now Will stay at Marriott or novotel next time Location good
 Understanding between booking com and the hotel as such Confusion over the rooms booked had occurred when we reached Staff was accommodating when they informed the room I had booked was no longer available but compensated with an upgrade promise for the next time and complimentary breakfast
 There were hairs in my bed and in my bathroom The pizza was disgusting and I could not eat it The breakfast was cold Internet was not free Very dated hotel No Positive
 The staff was unpleasant I got the worst room in the hotel on the first floor at the end of the hall right next to the service room Also the room had a view on huge works it looked like i was sleeping in the works being done The condition and the cleanliness of the room were very poor I asked at the reception to change rooms I was moved to a slighltly better room But again the room looked very old and not clean The room was very noisy at night because of the overground There was even a smell of cigarettes although it was a non smoking room Also the heater in my room was not working The Air conditionning was put at 25 degrees As i was cold at night i called reception and they sent me a heater Of course the heater was in very poor condition and no one noticed that the plug was completly burned I had to call reception again to get another heater The maintenance of the hotel is very bad the conditions of the rooms as well It is a shame that this hotel is rated as a 4 star hotel It should have at mosttt 3 stars I hope i will never have to sleep in this hotel again  Nothing 
 Could not adjust room temperature only by staff opening window Worked but let all other noise in Not ideal For a two day visit ideal Good location did not venture far only by foot
 Our room was really run down and was like a sauna We called reception and they came and opened a window but still didn t cool the room down Worst night sleep ever Bearing in mind this was December Location is quite close to Canary Wharf tube station
 The fact that I paid extra for a view and got a building site outside which woke us up at 7 30am on Saturday morning to start work The old deco and furniture The thin walls between rooms  The size of the room
 Beds were uncomfortable and there was strong smell of cigarette smoke in bathroom This was dealt with by the last night of our stay  Location great for O2
 I arrive when the night staff are on after an 10 or 15 hour shift and they are always rude and unhelpful Also this last stay I booked a double room and was given a room with a single bed Location
No Negative Beds comfy Drinks at breakfast were horrible Orange juice was diluted with water Apple juice tasted like a sugar syrup Food was okay Cant say I would be re booking 
 The room was not well maintained old fitting and furniture there is a building site next door They stated work at 7 30 on a Saturday The room was a good size
 The 140 pound a night room stunk of smoke was freezing cold and constant noise coming from the heating system which you can t turn off The carpet was dirty and dust everywhere We were unable to sleep so early hours moved to another room with the same problem The last thing you need when you ve had a whole day shopping in london On arrival we knew we d made a bad decision the decor was dated there was people all over the place drinking cans of Stella and couldn t get any staff to help us with anything After complaining and requesting a refund as it completely ruined our stay and 140 pound for the service just isn t good enough We were offered a COMPLIMENTARY UPGRADE for next time we stay We won t be staying ever again and an UPGRADE costs 20 pound on top of minimum 140 so what are they playing at Britannia far from it no one is British in there and I wouldn t ever recommend this to my worst enemy  Location was ok
 All the little charges for what I would expect to free extras such as use of the pool gym wifi Hotel shows signs of a lot of wear and tear Maybe as the area is rapidly developing this hotel will step up their game  Great breakfast great public areas Good location in an up and coming waterfront area Very handy to Canary Wharf Underground station which gives really easy access to the main tourist areas Very friendly and helpful staff 
 I had several boxes when I arrived and on a Sunday evening nobody came to assist me apparently they could not take the luggage trolleys outside The Hotel bedroom was unbearably hot and when I called Reception they said heating was not working properly The bathroom was fairly small The meal in the restaurant was good
 Quicker response more understanding more customer service pre arrival First of all the hotel refused to amend my booking to either the following week or add a night on I had to make a completely separate booking then they wouldn t guarantee I wouldn t have to change rooms There were mice in the bar the heating wouldn t turn off in my room was told categorically that they do not do refunds the time delay in waiting for a response took over 3 hrs although the manager when I did see him did swap my room the following night didn t help that night overall I didn t think paying nearly 600 for 3 nights was worth it 
 Breakfast was only available with voucher at check in Not worth the prices Prefer a ala carte option  Room clean and good Wifi was not convenient 
 I was billed for WIFI that didn t work the staff dealt with this poorly by arguing with me in an accusatory and aggressive manner then proceeded to charge me No Positive
 Bedroom furniture is very tired Towels very worn Can t believe even a struggling hotel has the nerve to charge for wifi access if you need more than 40 minutes in 24 hours  Great location for Canary Wharf The charge rate is low but this is reflected in the generally tired quality of the hotel and rooms Great water pressure in the shower
 You could feel the springs through the the mattress the constant drone of trains and paper thin walls meant sleep was sparse When I actually got up I realized what an utter disgrace the room was Furniture was scuffed or broken bed frames were rickety with metal bits hanging off blood stains on the carpet stains on the walls and bathroom ceiling and ripped upholstery and wallpaper The overall decor was also extremely dated I was offered a window view but couldn t see out as the windows were filthy Also there was one usable socket for a phone charger but this was not near the bed or seating area and most of the light switches didn t work  Reception lobby Christmas decorations were pretty 
 The hotel was exceptionally busy when I stayed but there was only two bar staff on and you had to wait 20 minutes to get served  Easy to find friendly staff 
 Everything looked shabby Food wasn t great Staff seemed confused by simple English They spelled my name wrong  The bed was quite good and all the furniture though clearly quite dated like The Grand Budapest Hotel was lovely old hardwood 
 Room and standards were awful First room had people s things in it when we got into it Total incompetence and no effort to offer any discount If we wasn t so tired we wouldn t have stayed  Nothing
 It s not a dislike but it s not central enough but the price makes it worth booking time and time again  Enjoy the stay again this is the 2nd time we ve been here Always the cheapest for a 4 star hotel and know doubt we all be booking again in the near future 
 Breakfast was lovely just could do with a little more staff interaction  The hotel room had a lovely view and we found the staff to be very welcoming and helpful Very pleasant stay and would certainty recommend a little out of town but not too far away quieter and very close to Canary Wharf tube station and both south quay and herons quay dlr stations too very conveniently minutes away from the hustle and bustle after a short ride Quirky hotel too Thank you 
 It was too hot in our room we asked them to look at the air conditioning but they just opened the window We were on the 9th floor and it meant noise level increased but at least the room was a little cooler It was nice atmosphere and good staff
 Quality of room old furniture and very uncomfortable beds and quality of food from room service is very poor as well hamburger was burned and cold  Location staff prices
 It was extremely cold when I got in The thermostat allowed me to put the temp higher but there was only cold air coming in I received a heater which saved me The furniture is very old There are no plugs by the night stands I tried moving the night stand to remove the lamp but to my surprise that plug was smaller than a regular UK plug AND there was trash behind the night stand Everything about this hotel is outdated The breakfast is very cheap definitely not worth the extortionate amount of money I was charged per night And to top it all off upon checkout I needed an invoice with my company details details which were already provided at checkin and also details which were transferred to the hotel from my booking account Needless to say that the guy at the reception had no idea of what I needed and claimed my company details were not provided when I actually wrote them down manually at checkin as well so that s 3 sources for the same information Very disappointing  The location is the only thing going for this very old hotel Also I had a free room upgrade and my room was very very very big The view was also very nice 
 Hotel has seen better days wear and tear everywhere Construction sites next to the hotel Noisy airconditioning  Few minutes walk to Canary Warf Good public transport for all directions within walking distance 
 Very old tired inside needs a complete overhaul but keeping the old style of it as really is well worth keeping  It s a beautiful looking hotel on the inside the front entrance 
 the plug was not working In the room Where the kettle was but I found one close Check in abit slow Enjoyed my stay very relaxing close to transport and shops Quick checkout
 The service is not great the check in staff were unfriendly and wouldn t let me check out the night before The decor is old tasteless and renovation is way overdue All of the gold plate on the taps were worn off The shower was disgusting the water pressure weak and the temperature hard to control The room itself feels dirty and run down and I was stunned to open up my bedroom door be confronted by a spiral staircase up to my bedroom which was a challenge with a suitcase It s one of the cheaper hotels in the Canary Wharf area but still at this price one expects more  The location is top for Canary Wharf The view from the room is outstanding 
 Furniture in the room would ve needed some updating Edges of the fitted carpet started to come off the floor The construction site outside of the hotel was making a lot of unpleasant noise  The room was clean Housekeepers did a great job every day during our stay Friendly staff 
 The room was far too hot the windows did nt open and the only ventilation was hot air if you wanted ventilation it had to be air pre heated to 30 degrees celsius so uncomfortable at night when I complained to reception I was told to simply turn the fan off still far too hot The breakfast was pricey but well presented and of a good standard and variety
 The room was very tired looking and needs to be updated expected a lot more for a four star hotel The receptionist never said where the breakfast room was or evening meals didn t promote the fact you could eat at the hotel Breakfast was average wasn t worth the money I paid Was disappointed with the amount of money I paid  Room service was very good 
 For second time in a row I went there after making reservation with few days upfront and they told me there is not any other room with window and also no more double bed for a Couple available as I had requested After that they told me the only left one was a 20 more expensive each day  The viewing was ok But privacy was best 
 first night almost no heating after complaint a bit better second night but still cold second night wifi stopped working they put me through to the provider Bitbuzz to sort it out myself I had to help them understand they had a problem with the router They said they would call me back once fixed but they never did Eventually it was fixed but I only found out late at night few sockets in the room and in weird locations no socket in bathroom main light could be switched off only from one side of bedNo Positive
 Queued far too long for a drink at end of night 8 people waiting and receptionist wouldn t help Woken up at 810 by housekeeping to see if had checked out or not  Generally clean and comfy
 Not impressed with the additional 20 fee for the luxury of having a bedroom with a window Shower fluctuated from scolding hot to ice cold The room was dated with tatty furniture Room not particularly clean and too hot Towels were a bit small  Convenient location
No Negative Average Rooms not especially warm neither was the water for a morning shower Staff would benefit from customer care training though the service was good at reception
 Loved the outside and the inside of the building very posh high end but as you step into your room it s like walking through a time capsule back to 1950 need to returb the rooms  Loved the outside and the inside of the building very posh high end but as you step into your room it s like walking through a time capsule back to 1950 need to returb the rooms 
 We ordered a pizza each from the restaurant the staff that answered the phone began laughing as they answered When I received the pizza as it was homemade it was very bland and had lack of flavour I ended up eating a salad for dinner 2 The room is too pricey and the breakfast costs too much also the restaurant prices are ridiculous 3 Why do you have to pay extra to use the swimming pool and Suana That is not good enough after paying over 90 for one night 4 When you use the facilities that are there in the swimming pool area you pay a 1 for a towel that can not even for you re body It just about covers you re hand as a hand towel 5 I requested a smoking room online and it said I selected a non smoking room when I booked The website is not clear enough and keep reloading  We had air conditioning which helped as it was cold and then hot in the room overnight The bed was comfy but not as great to sleep on pillows are too soft for my personal liking etc 
 Everything costs extra after 20mins of internet you have to buy a voucher for more GBP7 Gym and swimming pool not included Very old building huge construction site next to itNo Positive
 Asked for a double bed but instead got two single beds put together with a single bed sheet to hide that One of the best pillows had stain on it the toilet flush made so much noise and went on what seemed like forever The price did not justify the stay was expecting a better stayNo Positive
 Too noisy and unhelpful staff Would not stay again if I wanted a good night s sleep  I did not enjoy my stay so find it difficult to think of any good points 
 The staff was friendly but very inactive They are super slow in processing and feel like they are putting me to sleep  Nicely located no tricks to get there and walking distance to the nearest tube station Excellent for short business trips and possibly good for a short travel People complained about the no window room and the old style but honestly for the price you pay I cannot expect golden carpets and a private pool Its a good place and I would sleep here again 
 The DLR outside is on the noisy side The room smell of stale cigarette smoke Small towels Sensitive Fiddly taps to get shower temp right Rooms are is on the tired side  Friendly staff Location 
 Being charged more than what was agreed when booking with yourselves instead of paying 223 I ended up paying 243 I wasn t happy about that at all  All the places to visit if interested
 Room looking a little let go Wall paper peeling in bathroom and toilet handle in wall loose  Stayed here before great location Would stay again 
 rooms are a bit dated free wifi would have been nice but 7pounds not bad for 24h but only for 1 device noisy building site next door  Fairly good location to get to canary wharf fair price
 The noise from the trains until01 00 and the noise from the large building site from 07 30 I ll fitting windows meant hardly any sleep The location
 Went to get a bottle of water and come back to the room for a shower to find the maid had stripped the bed and removed the towels and told me to check out because she had started on the room Not a great start to the day  The location and price was perfect
 Broken Air conditioning on the 7th floor meant our rooms were heated to 30 degrees Celsius and only able to cool down to 28 It was like sleeping in a boiler Very bad night s rest even with just a sheet Cleanliness in the common parts is very poor Windows are filthy Generally a lack of pride in the place from the management Staff can be o k but all look a bit depressed No doubt due to the poor quality of leadership in the place Left a shirt in the room by mistake They did at least try to find it But lost to the laundry no doubt  Good location Easy to reach
 Dont go the the pizzaria I got pizza frozen and day after the worst burget it was only bread and meat I got the pics The room was stinky the pee they try to cover with some chemical stuff I got my throat hurt Gym club not free Internet not free I never pute negative like that on hotel but really dispointed They tried to sell me dinner voucher then i release the restaurat at night was always close in the last days a joke Nice old 5 star hotel Big room
 Room far too warm 25c had to leave window open apparently rooms have no a c in winter hotel very tired needs renovating Towels too small Breakfast horrible Coffee stewed not freshNo Positive
 Room Furniture extremely scuffed part damaged by kettle steam Carpet frayed and looked like water damaged by bathroom Corridor carpet frayed and scruffy No Positive
 got a parking ticket through the post after a week for staying at the hotel and parking in the carpark whilst providing details on checkin I have disputed and awaiting apology from Parking Eye who manages the car park and commination between the hotel and parking operatives need to improve No Positive
 A hotel such as Britannia should provide to their customers free WIFI during their whole stay at the hotel and not just 20 minutes  Food at the buffet Excellent breakfast options and quality of the foods Dinner buffet is even better 
 Gap on the side of window which made room very noisy Staff could have handled our noise complaint better Poor customer service  Hotel was nice and bed comfortable 
 Bathroom and shower poor condition Staff less than helpful particularly in the restaurant Breakfast buffet was of poor choice and quality The buffet area was very cramped and given the fact that guests were carrying hot water this could have potential for a nasty accident The room was clean and bed comfortable however in need of an upgrade The location is very good with easy access to Canary Wharf The concierge was the only pleasant and helpful member of staff 
 You couldn t open the window in room for fresh air It was too hot at night couldn t sleep due to this and no air conditioning only a fan which didn t do anything At one point it was 28 degrees c So uncomfortable Worst night sleep ever The rooms were very tired Furniture was scuffed and old When came to check in at 6pm there was a long queue and took nearly 30 minutes to check in stood in a queue it was not good when had a tiring day  The bar was nice
 Booked a Double Room on check in at 11 30 at night I was informed they only had a twin bedroom The only Choices were to take it or cancel the booking Too late to go anywhere else so we took the room couldn t enjoy our night together and the bed aggravated my partners Sciatica Not a pleasant stay  Spacious bathroom
 couldnt open the windows at all not even a bit wlan not for free but these are really small issues  we only stayed one night would recommend it for a short stay was really okay and the staff is very nice the only thing that bothered me was the location it was really far from where i had to be but if you dont care about such things its a really nice hotel pricey wifi but in the lobby it is free nice to have a drink and look at the water there are also rooms for smokers but i would recommend to smoke outside since you cant open the window
 Room was very small and wifi was not included free in the room like it used to be I had to pay additional for this  Great staff and as a regular customer it s always nice to be able to book a room at short notice 
 The wifi is provided only for 20 minutes a day unless you pay a fee for an extension The room was very comfortable and the 24h service at the reception was really effective
 Room was too hot 27 5 They sent a man up to open the window for us because they said that the air con could not be altered Also sent up a fan but this did not work Noisy in am with builders outside and window open Tea and coffee were cold for breakfast Better to make fresh for people  View from the room and location very convenient for us Chef made me 2lovely poached eggs Thanks for that 
 Charging to use the pool and for the use of a pool towel Getting one teabag per couple in the room Not being able to check in early without paying an additional cost Not getting enough toiletries per couple Furniture and appearance of hotel very tired and shabby Charging to leave luggage on arrival day No Positive
 Bed was very uncomfortable thermostat unable to amend as room was too hot Receptionist insisted on taking an additional 1p on my card even though it was fully paid Location to O2
 Duck tape square on ceiling obviously hiding a needed repair Was asked if I wanted to upgrade to a room with a window for 20 It was Sunday night so I think if rooms were still available they could have upgraded for free Reasonable price for location Close to DLR Room was clean bed comfortable
 the extra costs associated with WiFi Gym Quality of Breakfast poor albeit a good selection Maybe concentrate on quality rather than selection quantity Location idea for my business trip meetings 
 Room 530 The temperature for the shower was hard to control between red hot freezing cold and the plug for the bath was broken so it was constantly emptying unless you put your heel on it The building site next door wasn t a problem until the concrete pecker started up at 07 30  Plenty of seating in the reception bar area even though it was all a little too low Rooms were nice and spacious but a little outdated 
 There is a Hilton located 100 metres from this hotel I suggest to spend 10 a night more and stay at the Hilton instead of this hotel The hotel desperately needs to be refurbished all communal areas share decor with the hotel from The Shining there were also a lot of problems with basic functions which most people take for granted in a hotel such as plumbing and air conditioning There was a problem with the tap which controlled the temperature of the shower making it impossible to adjust the water temperature I informed the hotel but they did not fix this before I returned to my room the following evening The air conditioning in the room was not working with the ambient temperature 32 C when I arrived I could not open the windows because they had been fastened with screws I also object to having to pay extra to use a hotel gym especially when the gym is in such a poor state with ancient equipment and holes in the walls No Positive
 The beds no working air con no Opening windows horrible decor huge amount of construction work right outside the Hotel with no attempt at warning the guests Miserable staff No information offered on check in No interest when complaint made  It was near the 02
 Pretty bad experience Cab that was called to take us to Gatwick was the hotels preferred cab company and overcharged us Thief would be too kind for this cab driver  Not too much 
 No free Wi Fi in the room Payable Wi Fi is unreasonable expensive 7 00 for 24 hours Very bad air conditioner in the room it is not operated Very noisy outside Very poor breakfast and small restaurant Small towers in bathroom Very bad working a tap in the bath and shower  Close to tube station
 Quite a walk to nearest station Room was very hot and didn t seem to respond to control unit Bathroom looked tired and had a low cost makeover some time ago Expensive fine 120 if one hadn t booked car in parking garage or paid in advance not notified when booking room  Very good choice of on site places to eat Room well furnished Staff friendly and helpful Great views from 7th floor Onsite parking 
 The breakfast was really simple according to the price of it Not variety And there isn t wifi in the room  The staff Maria Antonia of the recepion was really kind and she helped us a lot 
 Front desk could have been more forthcoming but i did arrive late so perhaps that is a reason After asking they provided a second room it was then comfortable but with a room heater instead of central heating
 Booked in late after plane delayed was held up at reception for nearly 30 mins when I just wanted my Booked Room and sleep Building site next door not helping either but I guess that why its cheap  Spacious rooms
 Not Soundproof rooms heard alot of things i did not want too The remote control didn t work  Comfy bed the design of the hotel location was good 
 Was given complimentary upgrade to room with a river view but the view was completely blocked by some kind of metal units on the adjoining roof Can t really complain too much though as I originally booked a room without a window Maybe just don t advertise it as a room with a view No Positive
 The rooms were very tired with damaged furniture and the bed you could feel the springs through what was a very hard mattress  The staff were friendly Getting through reception was fast 
 The wi fi should be free for the length of the stay not just for 20 minuites The room was spacious with a fantastic view over the Thames Breakfast was extra but good value 
 Single beds are very narrow and I mean very  Staff attitude very helpful nice and welcoming Large rooms with plenty of space wardrobe and spotless clean The Retro feeling is charming 
 The heating wasn t controllable for our room The staff had putting the fans on override so that it always blew out hot air even when choosing cool We had to go to reception on more than one occasion to complain At 11 45 pm we still couldn t sleep and was very uncomfortable so I made my way back down to reception where I had to wait in a long line of people checking in I was very tired They said they would send someone up to open out window which had been screwed shut 12 15 am we finally had a nock on the door where a member of reception came in with a spanner and a tool to open the window This meant I had to sit awake to let them in It took a good half hour for the room to cool so finally got to sleep gone 1 00 am We were told that the windows were screwed shut because of the outside noise I m sure customers should be allowed to choose whether or not they can handle the noise with the window open On top of this the member of staff didn t leave us with any tools to close the window This meant we had to sleep and all night and morning with the window wide open as there was no way of shutting it with out This caused the rain to come in the window too Came away from the trip with two poor nights sleep and not feeling refreshed at all  Location drinks and food 
 The room was described as river view and it was construction site and windows so dirty could barely see Beds were not fit to sleep in Dirty toilet wet bath matNo Positive
 Very long wait for checkin and generally looks too 80s Lots of old signage around looking tatty Big room family room Well priced for last minute stay Replacement iron sent to room very promptly
 Very noisy due to construction site and train cleaning servis terrible old rooms need to be reconstructed serving same boring breakfast everyday wifi paid in the room Good location if you have meetings in Canary wharf free wifi in the lobby
 Most of the receptionist were brilliant but this guy called John was an absolute disgrace to customer service he made a very simple task a scene and as difficult to resolve for no reason A man called Stonney resolved the issue within 30 seconds which I really appreciated but still appalled by that man called John if he cannot tolerate ppl maybe it s best he doesn t work in that role Apart from that great stay fast room service No Positive
 Was a bit noisy because of the construction going on the proximity of the railway station  The location was perfect for our needs all London transport links 
 Looked like it s never received any care since it was built Staff seem stressed out and come over as miserable and uncaring Lots of shouty paper signs pinned around threatening fines for various things No Positive
 I didn t try breakfast or Indian the food in the bar wasn t the best  Hotel is very decent for the location and facilities provided its a 5 minute walk over the bridge from Canary Wharf tube station and has some restaurants nearby and also an Indian restaurant inside Bar Restaurant with Sky sports 
 Hard to find entrance with all the renovation work going on The decor of the rooms was a little tired and not enough coffee tea milk supplied  Lovely big rooms and breath taking views of the docklands Easy distance to the central tube lines and lots of space to relax Great value D
 Horrible experience First of all the reception staff did not advise us that we had to pay for swimming and the towels which is totally unfair as we are already paying for the stay Second off all the swimming facilite and sauna was very dirty felt like a cheap swimming lesiure centre We told the staff we will pay extra to stay and they said okay we get to our room and it is locked We was very upset with this Would never go back The room was up to standard
 The facilities are a bit old It is clean but they let me dirty crockery twice in four days  It was a good experience in general The people was really nice 
 Room temperature fluctuated between cold and too hot Advised by reception that this was a problem that they d had a while but couldn t fix Was given the option of opening a window overlooking the noisy tube line or a fan Difficult to sleep Very tired decor quality of room service was poor and staff service could be much better  Nothing I can think of
 WiFi is only free 20 mins Then they charge extra A no go fir any hotel No fridge in the room and no ice machine Gym and pool cist extra  If you want to be in Canary Wharf the hotel has a good location Good lobby area with bar and resraurant 
 Room very hot and then when I put air con very loud so you had to choose hot or noise when trying to sleep Also Bed and mattress I can say was the worst I have ever slept in I recently staying in a easyJet hotel and it was basic but I had good night sleep and room clean Plus cost half what I paid here The duty manager very good and understanding but said he would make sure room would be as it should next time I stay  Not much to be honest Location good for what I wanted and parking at hotel 
 Reception very slow and not helpful Everything is wifi pool kids breakfasts at adult prices Continental breakfast not nice Fixtures fittings in bathroom were old and not functioning properly Air temperature in Spa was very cold Sauna lukewarm and door broken Old equipment showers not regulated too hot  Room was spacious Conscierge was very helpful Italian restaurant was nice
 Directions on hotel website for getting to the hotel from DLR Sent two e mails no reply then had to call premium number and then directions were not correct not nice when arriving late at night in cold and rain alone and not knowing where to go No Positive
No Negative Excellent friendly staff nothing too much trouble VERY clean rooms and overall throughout the hotel Good choice of food in the hotel Italian restaurant was excellent and good value too Breakfast was very good too Only complaint was my room 138 was close to the stairs and there was a lot of loud voices on and off through the night Maybe a polite notice for guests coming in late to respect that most other guests may be sleeping 
 The room was not clean the bathroom had broken taps the walls were dirty and very dated The car park facility was poor not suitable to park cars and expensive for the time I was there No bottle water in the room  The bed was comfortable and the extra pillows I asked for I recived
 Room and hotel could have been a little warmer although was exceptionally cold day  Room 140 freshly painted new carpet huge window view quiet Ultra clean everywhere Friendly helpful staff Great breakfast variety Easy transport access
 Found bugs in the extra blanket we needed to use Heating system was automatic room felt hot all the time at one point the temperature of the room was 30 degrees Room was a good size with really good views 
 The room I was in on the 9th floor was extremely hot i e it was 27 degrees Celsius when I got in there at 9pm The air conditioning was noisy so was difficult to leave it on when trying to sleep and all in all I had a poor night s sleep there  Decent Breakfast nice bar and evening food was good
 Quality of breakfast needs big time improvement I had similar Break fast at the Solent Hotel and the Quality was so good compared to Britannia Location
 Staff was not friendly room was pack nothing deferent to shell in the jail no window no ventilation system when I was aske about that they ask me to pay extra 20 for the window it was about 27 digress in the room can not breath they have provid a small fan Which was not make any deferent  Nothing in this hotel
 Service cleanliness not friendly beds too small hole in ceiling of room 159 159 is impossible to find One of the staff took my credit card and lost it Nothing
 It was clearly built in the 80s and has barely been touched since Quite a surreal experience The only staff I found to be up to grade on customer care were in the restaurant  It is cheap compared to others but you get what you pay for It seemed to be clean 
 why was the hotel confirmation different to the one I had made online  Was not happy as booked family room but hotel s confirmation was different from mine which I booked through booking com They gave me a room with 3 single beds I was with my husband and 2 children They wanted to charge me for a room that sleeps 2 adults and 2 children which is what I had booked thank God I had my confirmation They later told me it was booking com s fault I was tired and had travelled with my family for a funeral and this was the last thing we needed 
 A charge at every turn Upgrade your room for 20 so you have a window Pre printed form appears Is their wifi free in reception 7 per device in the room can I use the Swimming Pool Yes there is a separate charge for that pay at the pool Not as competitive as first seen Also major major building work happening next door at this point in time foundations are being excavated for what looks like another Shard  Room service food was good quality and punctual 
 No window In the room which I guess was reflected in the price Room service was charged at 5 per order We decided against ordering for that reason We were only on the first floor and a short walk from the restaurant  We only stayed one night but the hotel was very nice 79 for a double room with ensuite bathroom with two single beds locked together Comfortable enough The room was clean and so was the bathroom It was a good area for us and close to the gig we were going to We bought some fries to take to our room from the restaurant which were a good size and tasted nice Overall a good experience and the staff were pleasant 
 Needs decorating Bed wobbly and headboard loose Bath had mound round edges When checking in asked about pool times and went to pool to be told it has been closed for days This is the reason we booked the hotel because it had a pool so very disappointed Spiral staircase to room Staff friendly Location
 Staff the rooms the deco the fact it took 2 hrs to get my window opened and further 1 hr to get it shut which ment it was almost 1 am once aka got to bed Nothing
 Impolite staff they offered no apologies or reassurance when they told us that the 5 rooms we reserved with booking had not actually been booked It took around an hour until they could rectify the mistakes Two of us had to change our rooms because of noisy fans and cold roomsNo Positive
 You get what you pay for I guess Oh plus 21 to park 7 Wifi 4 to use the so called filthy gym And you want a window with that room a further 20 Rooms are tired and extremely worn out Very hot and uncomfortable Air con very noisy Staff inattentive and miserable Worth paying extra to stay elsewhere and have all the above included I guess Never again Seems quite standard from Britannia from what I have also heard countrywide Avoid  The only positive is location 
 The property is in a state of decay it feels like being in a train station with buses of tourists coming in and out its such a pity as it could be a great hotel if they would have invested anything to improve it and refurbish itNo Positive
 the AC was too noisy all the time you could listen strange noises coming like from building construction even through the night very good location if I consider that the subject of the trip was linked to Canary Wharf area
 The uncomfortable beds Pillows were terrible The air con that was on all night in NOVEMBER which made me wake up with chapped lips because obviously i can t handle the 8 hour arctic chill we had spots of what i assume was blood on the wall and the green light at the door makes the room glow  i liked having a place to sleep
 The rooms was warmer than enough I have called the reception 10 minutes later one of staff came to my room then just open locked window but it s still hot because the temperature control fixed on 28 5C  Money value 
 Room was much too hot Bed too hard Overall the place needs up dating  Good location for the O2 Executive room was spacious with balcony overlooking Canary Wharf Good breakfast 
 we selected a smoking room but was not given one apperently with the booking we made were not allowed to have one we have to pay 20 pounds if we wanted a smoking room but if we wernt allowed to have a smoking room why give that option if and when you bookNo Positive
 Sound proofing from other rooms No one to monitor noise after 1pm No one in the reception area when we left at 6 30 security Convenient to O2 and station Clean and warm
 mid week is very expensive that s the only thing that would stop me staying more often front desk staff were fantastic I have stayed at this hotel several times and the front of house staff were always kind and helpful and made my stay especially when I was staying alone 
No Negative Overall a pretty good value for money although wifi should have been included free of charge considering that apartments these days are offering that 
 The staff could be a bit more cheery  Quirky and Eccentric hotel with a great steam room spa facility and a pretty decent Sauna Reasonable food and drink prices too I would visit again 
 The hotel looks and feels very tired room corridors were not kept as clean as I would expect in fact bottle tops remained on the carpet for the entire 24 hours we stayed breakfast felt more like a mass canteen environment no table service at all not even for tea which in my experience would be normal for the price of the stay I had expected a much better experience The location was good for accessing transport etc
 Expensive if wanted brekki Gym pool should be included in price Price was high for room Aircon didn t work in room Pizza was not fresh from resturant  Bed was very comfy Staff were pleasent 
 Cleaner walked in at 10 telling us we had to leave check out was at 11 she hadn t realised the clocks had gone back Location was amazing Bar was open late so could run down for drinks when thirsty in night
 Staff on reception friendliness and care Listening to customer requests on booking which were not taken care of  The room facilities and cost for one night in relation to the restaurants 
 Hotels shouldn t charge for wifi in 2016 My room had a problem with the shower and water was cold Didn t happen to my friend in another room  Great breakfast excellent location for Canary Wharf and beautiful place
 Air con next to useless bed lumpy only one coffee each in the room Facilities tired need updating bathroom similar towel quality poor very tight storage in wardrobe The location close to where we needed to be
 The door to the bathroom did not close and you had to step over the toilet to get in the shower I did not think that this was acceptable for a hotel in LondonNo Positive
 It s a freemium hotel Sure the price is reasonable but you only get 20 minutes of Wifi in your room for free after that you have to shell out money To access the fitness center you have to pay breakfast is not included you can t borrow an adapter for the room and the only way you can buy it is cash I never carry cash with me it s impracticle now that you can pay with almost anything with the card The italian restaurant in the hotel was average or below average The pizza tasted barely better than a frozen Dr Oetker pizza so very poor value for money there  The hotel is fairly well located if you have a meeting in the Carany Warf area and at a decent price within the EU Commission s budgetary rules The rooms are nice as is the bed bathroom etc The staff was relatively nice 
 I had very noisy neighbours who had a party till 2am on the balcony and started again around 5am I was in room 1146 they were in the next room towards the end of the hallway I did not see a phone to dial reception so I barely slept No Positive
 We paid for an upgrade and had to change rooms due to cleanliness and very poor state of decor and repair New room slightly better but bed very uncomfortable Mattress was very old and discoloured No offer to help move our luggage to new room No apology from anyone re our problems  Nothing 
 I did not like the breakfast menu Can add more Indian items Room was too small  I liked location of the property and th biryani at the Indian restaurant 
 Place is worn and beds old and uncomfortable Cleanliness of bathrooms is not good Paid 164 for an exec double expecting a decent standard would have been better in travelodge or premier inn Breakfast was cheap produce and badly organised Nothing
 The extortionate parking charges were not made clear at the time of booking The parking surcharge was over 33 of the room cost  Room was spacious with a very high ceiling also the room had a sofa and coffee table which was nice and convenient
 The fact I upgraded to a no smoking room with a window only to find the room smelling of cigarettes A mere apology was given to me instead of offering me something worth my while The lift was scary too as it rattled a lot when going up There was constant noise coming from the bathroom even if the lights were switched off No free wifi either  I upgraded from a no window room only to be presented with a no smokinh room stinking of cigarettes The management did change the room but nothing else was offered to please me as a form of apology The decor is old and there was a lot of deep cuts on the walls Overall not bad but I expected a bit more class and the wow factor wasn t really present Would probably think twice before booking again Unless desperate 
 Bath was dirty and not clean Noise from what we think was a generater which was on all night Staff in the resterant wernt that welcoming  Great views
 Rooms are stale although we got a window we couldn t open it they were dirty from the outside air conditioning didn t do what it supposed to the mirror lighting and extractor fan in the bathroom didn t work Had to pay extra for everything else pool parking and WiFi We stayed over the weekend and found out later that on street parking was free after 6 pm on Fridays The staff should have mentioned this  The location is good 
 The breakfast was unorganised No idead how you got a pot of tea As you had to serve yourself food or drinks would be cold due to queues Should have at least had tea coffee served at your table  East to park room with a view over the river
 Room too warm Partner found hair in breakfast twice Spoke to Manager who dealt with it  Couldn t fault room Bed comfy and big although think 2 pushed together 
 There was some mildew at the ceiling approx as large as my palm and the socket where the hairdryer was plugged in did not work either  The room was spacious and well equipped Even we choose a room described as no window we had a nice view to the channel 
 Building site adjacent to our room was far from ideal we had no indication before travelling that this was the case Windows were filthy inside and out and so view of the harbour from the lounge was spoiled No Positive
 Me and my wife had a terrible time the room was like a shoe box I thought we was paying for a deal of the day it was hurandous I m sorry all the swimming facility s was broke not happy The location
 It is a lovely hotel a bit old furnishing old and the hotel is a bit dark We had a water leak problem and the air conditioning unit didn t work  The staff were friendly and helpful
 On check in staff were in the process of changing shifts I understand this is necessary but as with my customer service job this should not be whilst there is a queue of people particularly at check in No apology offered until 10mins in  Great setting Fantastic bar and restaurant area and attached to another bar for change of scenery 
No Negative The bedroom was clean welcoming and very comfortable And the view of London and the Thames magnificent to wake up to The staff all paid great attention to us too My favourite place to stay in Canary Wharf
 Cost of upgrade should have been free In room dining menu needs more variety from the restaurants in the hotel The hotel was great Service was perfect Upgraded on arrival Would recommend to anyone
 The hotel was very old fashion it could do with a little revamp the bar had no atmosphere what s so ever me and my partner wanted a drink Saturday night after coming back from a show it was only 10 30pm and there was no music on nor ever just a little sound in the back ground so we took our drinks to the room as it wasn t nice to be in bar the parking was very expensive on top off what your already paying most hotel are free or just a little charge this was 60 for 2 days overall very unhappy with our stay Definitely won t be going to any of them hotel again  It was easy to get to the o2 Arena as it was just one stop away on the underground they had a good gym and pool there but I thought it was unfair to pay to use it 
 The heating air conditioning in the room did not seem to work and another couple said they had the same problem We turned the temperature down and it just shot up again  Clean tidy and bed was comfortable It gave us a good base Did not eat in so cannot rate the food but they did offer a deal on eating in that would have been very reasonable had it fitted with our plans
 Almost everything When I checked in I was told my room had no window I said I d like a window I was told that was 20 per night extra The internet costs 7 per device per 24 hours The breakfast was almost 14 each day Id never stay there again And I m UNHAPPY with Booking com for not making it clear that the room rate was for a box with no window  Nothing to really like The room was not filthy
 Staff and booking system When i arrived after booking a windowless room online they told be that they were all sold out of that room even though i had a successful booking confirmation So they said my only option was to pay even more money for a more expensive room and didn t even say sorry or give me any money off  Comfort Location
 Where to start Only chose it due to lack of time in booking something earlier so was based on price not anything else Lots of things need to be improved in today s modern world this hotel is old fashioned without the oldy worldy charms Its run down tired lobby lounge areas have a horrid smell that permeates into the rooms like very old cleaning solution that is not a nice fresh smell Didn t bother eating onsite as the restaurants looked old and menus very dull anyway in so many amazing choices in Canary Wharf why bother eating there prices too high for what looked like less than average quality food Lounge area very unfriendly bar was small and weirdly designed no charm or reason for it s strange layout not many choices in terms of cocktails or drinks sofas near the ground so you were basically sitting on the floor View of river was nice but for the filthy windows so that was a waste Room was ok overall No free wifi well for 20 min in the lounge area and in rooms that s a joke in this age no docking station in rooms no clock radio for alarm so needed phone but phone plugs are far away and near ground a joke Tv reception in room was lost on the last day but didn t matter as the tv was in a weird position on the wall and the visual quality was hardly there Shower curtain old and mouldy shower exhaust fan broken overall furniture looks tired and run down and over used parking spaces few and also looks like it s been used a dumping ground for the hotel s old furniture and rubbish hotel staff try hard but attitude of the desk clerks upon checkout was abysmal Might be reasonably priced but there is a reason  location some attentive friendly staff reasonably priced but you get what you pay for 
 How on earth is this 4 star PowerPoint presentations for reception screen updates signage stuck on reception with cellotape Unbranded tea and coffee in bedrooms toilet roll you used to get at school torn bedroom carpets Dated and old  Convenient location
 It s a little tatty perhaps but for the money it s no big deal  Just stayed on business in Canary Wharf and I d be back in a heartbeat The staff are without exception friendly and go out of their way to help you there s a lovely pool and spa that only costs 4 for a one off visit and the view from the river side is beautiful There s the odd frayed carpet but it s old and it s beautiful If a well loved hotel is going to put you off then go somewhere that s 300 If you value a hotel with a heart this is a total bargain 
 6 issues decor in my room was tired needs a refurbishment No 3 pin rectangle pin sockets next to the bed only round pins couldn t charge phone overnight TV GUI needs updating no TV guide menu available Had to pay for wifi these days you d expect a hotel like this to have it included My room overlooked a building site next door who started work at 7 30am and woke me up the cleaner then knocked on the door at 8am to make sure I was awake  Location was good 
 The water in the bath wasn t warm enough considering it was freezing the day of my visit  The staff were extremely helpful and very direct when asked for anything 
 50 of staff that I had contact with was on training and also lacked of fluent English Heating inside the room was not working properly Even with the Do not disturb sign on the door on every day I ve spent at the hotel the cleaning team kept entering the room ignoring the information on the door Paid WiFi 20 minutes free No safe deposit in room You had to pay for one at the reception 5 GBP Although is not the hotel s fault in the morning you get a lot of noise from the outside due to construction works on nearby buildings  At the arrival I was upgraded to a room with window without additional charge Nice Italian restaurant with good price quality ratio 
 The air conditioner could not be turned off and kept us awake all night We booked a double bed but was told one bed was not available until we made a fuss and then it was suddenly available  Price was good value considering the room was clean and tidy 
 Everything staff the room was small and pokey I booked a double smoking room and they gave me a room on the ninth floor and when I asked about the smoking they must have given me the worst room in the hotel these was to single beds put together and it was like sleeping on a bed of rocks their was no hot water on the first and second day it was just a big disaster would not go back to the hotel if I got it for nothing  Nothing
 The staff were rude bordering on obnoxious I booked a double room on the website however they moved us to a twin room with no window and no air conditioning And to top it all off they had the audacity to charge you for Wifi  The room was spacious and kept very clean The hotel itself wasn t too far from the tube station this made going back and forth to the centre of the city easier 
 4 knocks in the morning form 7 45 to 10 30 by house keeping when check out is at 11 Twin beds pushed together to make a double bed which is extremely uncomfortable Bed located under a dusty air vent so woke up with a cold Reception also questioned a booking for a double room because it was 2 females checking in and the situation was rude and extremely awkward No Positive
 Very noisy building site in operation throughout the stay Should have been informed before booking as travelled with autistic daughter Extras such as parking and WiFi very disappointing No Positive
 Room was cold the radiator wasn t working there was however a little electric fan heater the tv on the wall wasn t plugged in and we couldn t find a socket near it to plug it in  This was our second stay here clean comfortable nicely decorated room Car parking convenient 
 The room was very poor Towel had stain duvert cover was wear and tear at side very cheap furniture in room Bathroom was simple and plain There was a construction outside So you can hear the building noise at very early morning The room just like b b type  The hall is nice decorated 
 The hotel really needs updating the room was shabby the bed was only a small double had the exec suite more like a standard double would not stay here again It was close to transport links Canary Wharf
 Very noisy cleaning staff in morn loud talking banging noise from them DEF NOT worth the normal price of room they say 230 DEF a one of stay there  Price as was last minute booking 
 Didnt like the fact that we could only stay one night 0  The location was amazing We got upgraded from a room with no window to a room with a large window and a balcony Great room clean tidy good facilities 
 confusing room numbering so wandered the corridors for a while  Location was great pity about the noisy building work but can t blame hotel for that
 I would rate this hotel in poorest catogory reason being the hotel staff specially the indian restaurant they have restaurant staff ill mannered dont no how to deal with customers They kept me waiting for more then a hour for my food They were busy in serving other english people After one hour we left from restaurant mention to the manager next they charge 50 pounds to serve in room what the hell man yo are running a hotel and you running these types of policy and ill mannered staff Out of 10 I will give zero 0  Location 
 No air in room fan Difficulty locating room Breakfast hours not posted Concierge very helpful Cash machine broke down processing Clean sheets Restaurant and hospitality
 The swimming pool being out of order  The location was good Not so far from the canary warf underground Some road work nearby made the access to the hotel a little longer The hotel was okay However the swimming pool was closed the entire weekend they said a flood had occurred the day we arrived and the staff kept saying the pool was going to open later on but that never happened We had a very upset little one who wanted to go swimming 
 A bit old fashioned and ornate showing signs of tiredness e g holes in the carpet and could feel the springs in the mattress  Very spacious room with all the facilities I needed Staff were helpful and friendly 
 The DLR and Underground were too far away especially when walking alone late at night There is construction all around blocking many shortcut paths so you have to walk all the way around to get where you are going The bed in the cheaper room was fairly comfortable but the one in the suite with a view was all springs NO CUSHIONING They need to get free wifi in the rooms It is 2016 Paying 7 50 per day for wifi Nope You get 20 free minutes per day only The showers are hard to control temp wise but they were powerful and pretty clean The hotel is very understaffed This combined with the very worn and dated decor explains the price Finally the place smells weird They need to get some Febreeze or something  They upgraded me to a nicer room with a view after one night due to an overzealous air conditioner you can t control the temp in the cheaper rooms and a non working room phone 
 I got sent loads of parking ticket even though I paid for parking  The location environment clean rooms good staffs above all excellent gym and pool
 Bath towels need to be much much bigger Perfectly acceptable for an overnight stay for work Yes it does need updating but it doesn t matter for me Stayed here quite a few times 
 The hotel looked very dated and my room probably hadn t been touched since the 1980 s My bed was slightly wonky as one of the legs was shorter than the others and my mattress was lumpy so I had to sleep on top of another duvet  A good location and very convenient for access to Canary Wharf and London Underground Friendly and helpful staff 
 Fixtures and fittings were old needed looking at Double bed was 2 singles latched together but didn t latch properly so kept coming apart  Simple mostly clean but very old hotel facilities 
 As a suggestion if would have been nice if the hotel would have provide toothpaste incase someone has forgotten there s  I was really happy with the overall service the hotel and the room 
 As others have mentioned the rooms could do with a face lift torn wall paper etc but at the price I paid I didn t mind this at all  Very friendly front desk staff upgraded my room which is a great policy to do if they are not full I had fantastic views 
 Very poor reception booking in took 30 minutes to be told come back later Issue at breakfast handled atrociously by the Duty Manager obviously trained in the Basil Fawlty school of hotel management No Positive
 The aircon is dated and noisy dusty room with stains on ceiling and walls I could hear the people in the next room very clearly On one occasion I received a notification of non payment of the car park charge but had paid No one can tell me why that happened In the gym 1 of 3 cross trainers worked I had to pay for late check out even though I heard on another occasion someone being given late checkout free  The views from the upper level rooms Convenient location Good breakfast John Paul on reception is very good at his job 
 Bed was the hardest bed I have ever tried to sleep in Room had stains on the walls had my do not disturb sign on the door and housekeeping kept knocking on the door to see if they could come in I had been working nights so wanted to sleep during the day not have them knock on the door throughout the day  Nothing
 Bed no so comfortable and paid wifi in the room is ridiculous Very inconvenient  Very clean great location Was upgraded to a larger room with a view Breakfast was good and reasonable price 
 Waited quite a while to check in which was not welcomed after a long day Cost of wifi is excessive when compared to other hotels  Comfortable and clean rooms On site restaurants and room service
 1 The room was huge for London standards but the bed was small and horrible Didn t slept well at all 2 You have to wait at least 20 minutes for the check in Last but not least You have to pay 7 pound per day for the internet and you can connect only one device A couple staying three nights have to pay 42 pound more than 50 euros for internet only This is unusual in 2016  1 Location was great 2 room s space 3 the view from the window 
 Staff on reception were extremely rude Double bed was two singles pushed together so extremely uncomfortable The leisure facilities were not open the whole stay fri mon staff were unsure when the pool would reopen location
 Check in is always incredibly slow and the staff can be frustrating This hotel is quite faded and a little out of context in this shiny new area I always ask for a smaller double bed as in the larger rooms it is twin beds joined together which I find really uncomfortable My last visit meant changing rooms three times It was annoying to be moved to a room with exactly the same issue and to take over 30 minutes to get into a room I ve also lost clothing there and despite e mails and me going there it was never recovered which is very poor The air conditioning doesn t work well in some rooms and the DLR sounds can be very noisy at night  It s a great location for Canary wharf and some rooms have excellent river views and often a fantastic price Showers are powerful and hot 
 Swimming pool was closed due to some works We couldn t take shower as it was very old and water was only hot There was no mini bar in our room The room was for non smokers but there was a strong smell of cigarets We had dinner in Italian restaurant downstairs the same which does room service food wasn t good at all and service was slow Overall this hotel is very old and requires renovation We paid half price 115 I must say it is definitely not worth the fool price at this condition  Our room was on 13th floor the view on Canary Wharf was amazing Standard Room was a very good size Girls in reception were nice and helpful 
 I was in this hotel in Dockland London on 24 Sep 2016 which I have book 3 rooms as I organise my friends to go to concert in Troxy on that night It was the worst hotel I ve ever stayed in my room very small not worth money that what I pay for which I could use this money to pay another hotel for 2 rooms I have very bad time there I have pay lots money for nice bed but end up to sleep in the car in the car park underneath building because bad service and very cold room which they put air condition on all the time and I could not turn off the air condition as no button in the room I did not ask them to help as I have a bad time with them when I was check in with staff up set me I felt terrible service badly trained staffs I did not feel welcome when I check in and staff not friendly when I ask information or need help she did not helpful and made me look stupid and their collages on the desk kept look at me while I was talking to her I booked the hotel there and I want to buy breakfast voucher as they advice on the phone before I came but the check in staff said no more voucher leaf and the breakfast fully booked we can not have any breakfast in the hotel and she did not advice what I have to do t and I have to go some where else for breakfast it doesn t make sent stay on this hotel and I have to pay taxi to go out the hotel to find breakfast and the hotel is not near any cafe or restaurant at all When I look on website there is parking available but when I got there I have to pay on top 21 and swimming pool cost 4 it should say clearer on website that we have to pay this extra it miss understand for costumer as it did not say that it will be charge on top on website nothing good like website said 
 When i book i was assigned a room without window which i believe nobody would have chosen to stay at the price of 95 per night I payed an extra 20 and got a suite at level 13 room 1301 on the curtozie of the staff which i salute as they were great In regards to the suite window was broken and wind was blowing through it all night No options in term of heating meaning i couldn t increase the room temperature and frezeed as a result i got a cold Room looked good but details like cleaness and integrity of the room rank like a 2 on a scale of 1 to 10 compared with the money paid Drawers were broken  Staff was great and very helpfull
 No wifi in the rooms Wifi speed is also not good Main disadvantage for business people Nowadays wifi is third important thing after air and water Reception staff take long time to checkin Looks like computer system is slow and software in not properly configured No Positive
 Its a maze to get to the room The walls are paper thin the couple next door were quite vocal Went to eat in Jenny s only to be turned away very disappointed  Huge rooms huge beds huge bathroom amazing price
No Negative Breakfasts were good but the accommodation is looking very tired and jaded We paid a discounted price which represented good value for money but the full room rate of circa 300 per night would have been way way too high for the standard of accommodation
No Negative The view in 904 was awesome As we entered the room I was shocked because the bed was huge and super comfy I pulled back the curtains and the view was amazing It was like a cinema screen looking over London 
 Breakfast was basic For the standard of the hotel I didn t think the food area was very pleasant I paid 10 but only had a piece of toast and a boiled eggs and coffee The rest didn t look very appetizing  Bedroom was clean but you would expect that anyway It is very dated though Needs refurbishing as everything is looking worn out 
 We were apparently upgraded but this turned out to be facing the building works and trains which wasn t helped by window not being able to close properly Close for our requirements
 Nothing at all  Probably the best hotel we have stayed in We had an excellent room on the first floor overlooking the water and Canary Wharf buildings amazing how many different birds there were to see The Indian restaurant was nice and the breakfast very good The whole ambience of the reception and service was top quality especially for the price The car park was ideal When we drove up outside the entrance my wife said this can t be the right hotel but it was We shall go back again 
 Grumpy guest on arrival making himself heard Furniture in rooms seemed old something from the 80s and tatty Gold taps in bathroom were very tired looking Hotel was clean but well used Mattress was lumpy Convenient
 When booking and also on arrival no information was given re the closure of some spa facilities ie the swimming pool and jacuzzi I guess they didn t want to loose customers Clean tidy friendly but no information was given about the closure of certain facilities
 The bedrooms were very outdated and spooky The cleanliness was poor Had to pay 5 for an ice bucket and glasses to be brought to the room We thought we would upgrade our room and to be honest the amount we paid for we were better off at the Hilton 20 mins only of free wifi in room  Staff was friendly
 only staff is making up for the poor facilities hotel awaiting demolition i guess judging by the overall status can hear the train wouldnt pay full price gym is from the 50s and falling appart Ended up paying half price Changing room is simply discusting there is a sona but didnt even bother to find out its status floor was covered in litter bottles mainly had to ask the reception to remove it bed was falling appart hotel entrance does not reflect the real status of the facilities only 20mn of free internet per day what a joke construction site next to it location is great a small indian restaurant inside and a pizza place hotel cheap buffet option too close to transport facilities was cheap for my booking but i guess i was lucky if you dont mind discomfort it s ok
 We paid for wifi however we couldn t connect in the room Apparetley it wasn t in range and we were told to go stand in the lobby which i think is ridiculous That was the only bad thing other then that it was good Friendly staff nice location
 I was offered non smoking OR a window Since when were they incompatible options And the bed was uncomfortable I could feel every spring  Good location for Canary Wharf but so is a lot of London
 There was no remote control for the TV the wall paper under the TVs needs a wipe down with a cloth also the bathroom door and the tiles in the bathroom were dirty the towels were supposed to be clean but had black marks on them the day we arrived the toilet had marks down it it needed bleaching I got charge for breakfast even though I presented my room key but I did get a refund the waitress in the morning we left did not clean the table right it should be completely sprayed with antibacterial and laid with fresh cutlery and not a cup and saucer of another table and the table should of had clean cutlery put down not just adding a fork to the knife that was already there Also the swimming pool was closed this was not advertised when I booked and it should have been Also at the end of the night I went for a hot chocolate drink before bed and there was none at the bar or the pizza place next door The sizes of the rooms the lobby and restaurant
 Quality of the rooms hotel WIFI Charges Tea making facilities furniture looked tired marked damaged Carpets in lobby stairs threadbare in parts  Location
 there was some small details that i didn t like Old room no good condition almost dead battery in remote control I paid 170 pounds for days and it was 100 Value for money Room was big and clean
 Pool spa that I chose hotel for was closed and no mention on website Staff manager not interested in any compensation for no pool spa whatsoever Despite expensive rooms there was no free wifi in room  Good location if you have meetings in Canary Wharf lovely old style decor and building
 the gym could be better looked after especially the lower level of the gym  Great location close to a station Canary Wharf station that offers you multiple destinations inside London Great view at the bar of the hotel good cleanliness standards in the rooms spacious and comfortable rooms Really good value for money 
 Old furnitures the bathroom looks dirty Have to pay for wifi come on it s 2016 Very slow reception staff  The view was very nice from our room Great location 
 Didn t get room booked had to stay in a Family Room which is in a poor state of repair The mirror in the bathroom slides open to reveal the gap between rooms you could talk to your neighbour in the next door bathroom CREEPY Someone could gain access to your room via the mirror it is not secured  Location good for Canary Wharf Cheaper end for the area 
 Room was dirty Leaking water tank over the bathroom The corridors smell and the room smelled Really not a nice place to stay Nothing to like except the location which isn t enough to recommend it 
 this is an over rated price hotel damaged furniture Noisy air conditioning units construction behind room Additionally the person at the front desk was beyond rude They charge a lot of money with all these bad stuff and at the top they make you pay for wifi unacceptable No Positive
 There are plenty of reason for why people should not stay at this hotel AIR CONDITIONER It does not work As everybody can guess we just froze in the room in late september STAFF One of the staff knock our door twice at 11 PM while we stand up from our beds he opened our door and said we need to call reception I still could not get how such thing is possible Why reception does not call rooms if they have something to say or the staff does not wait at least 10 seconds for door to be opened ROOMS The room was too old beds were uncomfortable The carpet was completely a cessful What is more there was such a disturbing smell coming from the toilet all the time WIFI You need to pay for wireless if you want to connect from your room No Positive
 The photos and reviews were excellent and i wanted a pool BUT The place is just shabby The lobby has ridiculous uncomfortable sofas and you have to go there for wi Fi or you have to pay for it That is reason enough to skip this place Not to mention scuffed furniture torn wall paper carpet worn and seams coming apart The location is next to a construction site on 2 sides the train track screeches constantly and the pool area was closed There is no reason at all to go there to visit London Its too far away from everything I was doing business in that end and thank goodness I had to leave early The service was fine No Positive
 the staff could have spoken and understood English better I lost count of how many times I asked for a childs bed in one of the rooms and we still didn t get one shower was dreadfulNo Positive
 Rather dated decor slightly grumpy employee greeted by thrusting out handing and barking I D When you re paying 100 a night for a very tatty room you d at least expect some customer care skills  Very handy for Canary Wharf tube station 
 Being placed in a room with a fan you cannot turn off nor being moved to a room with very poor lighting when I complained there was no alternative room after that so I stuck with it Restaurant overpriced for what I got decor was tired and sorely in need of being redone Worse prices normally at least 50 higher than what I paid At usual rate I would be outraged at poor standard  Bed was OK
 I did not like that there was no information from before or while i was booking to say that the health club was not working That is ideally why i booked this hotel So i wasted my money As all i could do is sit in the room If anyone is going to book hoping to use the facilities just call or something to check everything is working  The rooms was nice
 There was a hair in the bath tub on the ceiling there weer flies and foot prints on the glass there was no window which meant no fresh air One of the towels was dirty the lady the served us didnt smile at all  The bed was comfy the although gap in the middle was horrible and painful
 decor and facilities little out dated and internet was problem and was uncomfortable to buy connection and my roaming data connection was blocked so to encourage to purchase your internet services not cool  staff were excellent and helpful
 Standard rooms are very poor gaffer tape all over the ceiling broken toilet seat had to pay extra to upgrade room after complaining new room better but bed was very uncomfortableNo Positive
 The noise I had the worst night sleep in my life The first night I woke up and couldn t go back to sleep from the cooling fans outside The second night I didn t sleep at all absolutely none sleep as those fans are ever so loud It was so frustrating all I wanted to do is put my head in my hands and cry I tried everything I put some cotton pads in my ears I put a pillow over my head nothing It was horrible We booked a room without a window and when we got there they didn t have such room left so they upgraded us for a room with a window Perhaps if we had our original room we wouldn t hear that dreadful noise When we checked out the receptionist just asked what room number we were in and no how was your stay just ok thank you bye Also it was my birthday and the next day got kinda ruined as we were sooo tired I will never ever stay in this Britannia hotel again And I would really strongly advise everyone not to stay there It might be cheap but the fans are really loud I can t emphasise enough how bad it was really and so very frustrating  I liked the location It was nice and not busy at all There is few nice restaurants around and few shops I would stay in this location again I did like the look of the hotel to be fair and their gym was good enough for us 
 The building site out of my bedroom window The broken lift The rude unhelpful stuff and dated decor  Dated hotel Really over priced for what is offered Oh and the staff are rude 
 We were unable to heat the room although there was a thermostat in the room with controls but it could only be used for cold air DLR line is very close and you can hear the trains early in the morning  Location is excellent and well connected Staff is friendly and helpful Room was clean and well decorated 
 Terrible customer service Phone system didn t work needs major update advertised free wifi when only offers 20 min free wifi in room NEVER AGAIN  clean 
 20 25 minutes from london city Very clean with all the accomodations soaps bath gel etc Nice decoration Comfortable bed You can take a break in your room with a tea or a coffee
 It was almost a ten minute walk to the underground There was a lot of noisy building work going on in the immediate vicinity of the hotel which stopped in the evening night I didn t know how to turn off the air conditioner in my bedroom I should have asked at the reception but I wasn t bothered enough by it to ask The bedroom was spacious and of a good quality It had very good views of the Canary Wharf office blocks The ground floor area reception restaurant were very nicely presented The breakfast was of a good standard The staff were helpful
 The staff on reception were ignorant as they come didn t want to know any problems would rob the site out of your eye they wanted money for everything  Not much to like about hotel
 Very slow reception one member of staff at busy time 2pm Friday Poor WiFi reception and limited to 20 minutes Tired rooms small double bed Inclusive breakfast Location
 Room too stuffy and never got fresh bed hard towels way too small dated decor facilities were great rooms clean and adequate tons of hot water for shower and bath friendly room service
 We ordered room service we ordered steak the price was sensibe although we asked for medium rear and they brought us well done That happened with the two steaks we ordered For the rest everything awesome No Positive
 I booked the room and was surprised to find out in had no window unless I paid 40 GBP more Lack of control of other guests eating external food in public areas very smell hot food Check in slowest Ive ever experienced mad me late for important social engagement Good location Large well equipped room Bar has nice view and comfortable sofas
 The pool was not working when they told us it was and we already paid to use it and they didn t refund us Our food trays took ages to be removed and the bed was not comfortable at all especially as I m pregnant I paid almost a grand and wouldn t do it again  I liked the food it was good quality for the money the staff were all friendly and helpful 
 It is really Old poor infrastructure the carpet is dirty in now days NO free wifi is unbelievable The cost is just ridiculous  The only thing that is positive about Brittania s hotel is the location The Hotel needs to be completely refurbished 
 No robes no toothbrush or toothpaste Sauna wasn t working steam room and pool area needed updating or a good clean I was disappointed with the condition of the hotel considering the location  The bed was comfortable I guess 
 The distance to o2 and price of taxi there Pizza shop shut when I got back Nothing really Great stay Bed comfy Not much food choice late at night but the chicken sandwich was nice Pleasant staff Great experience Would stay again
 Check in was very slow had to pay for a upgrade to a room with a window Wifi the staff in the pizza restaurant were not very welcoming  Room was comfortable but dated 
 The bedding smells It says it s a double bed but it s combined with 2 single beds uncomfortable while sleeping in the middle of the double bed Also there are construction around canary wharf Some routes have limited access or blocked Noisy from the train passing by could be heard at night even when you are in the top floor of the hotel the room is fairly big but the light was going funny it will automatically light up the turn off 
 The only downside was that the room was very hot even when using the fan provided  Great location and good value The pizza from the restaurant downstairs was very good 
 I had requested a cot for my 8 months baby in my booking and It wasn t there when we arrived i asked the reception twice to bring it but they ignored me once and sencond time they said their maiden is off work at that time and they will bring it next day morning my baby fell down the bed the next day morning and nobody cared about that when i asked for manager he didn t want to talk to me or apologize instead he was trying to blame me for not taking care of my baby it was completely strange to me The bed in the room was at its worst condition springs out and injured my husbands leg they also told us that breakfast served until 10 30 but the second morning when i went down to restaurant at10 10 in the morning they said it is only on weekend up to 10 30 they didn t let me in Altogether it was an awful experience for us and we thank god that we got out of there with no more disaster  The only good thing about it was the cleaness of toilet and bath that was all
 the croissants were definitely of the fake non flakey variety maintenance not brilliant unidentified noise in bedroom necessitated move at 10 pm and staff had to be reminded to do something after half hour wait Sink plug handle did not work plug had to be removed by pulling with finger nail No Positive
 The room was not well appointed We were upgraded to a room with a window but it overlooked nothing Food wasn t great for the price Building works near by Decorated like the Titanic  The location of the hotel was good 
 room very shabby for price we paid fabric split on both chairs in room a cut out square of carpet in room and some of tiles in bathroom were yellow  breakfast had good choice
 The double room was 2 single beds pushed together and was very uncomfortable I have stayed in more comfortable beds at much cheaper hotels I would expect a king size bed in a room advertised as a double  The balcony overlooking the water was very nice Room was clean and tidy shower was good 
 Check in was a bit slow there isn t much around that we could find e g Shops and bars but it was close to tube station  Lovely setting on the river looks amazing inside with big chandlers etc 
 Staff looked miserable all of the time when u asked them for something eg drink at the bar it was like it was too much effort Also reception very rude when called for room service I was told they were too busy and to go down for it and the phone put down on me before I could reply Kinda defeats the object really  It was close to the o2 arena
 I had to change room as the carpets filthy only to change to another room where the carpets were also very stained The whole room appear tired and dated and not very clean The sheets also had a few stains on them The service lacked any real enthusiasm and very long wait to check in Would not recommend this hotel at all  The location was food
 Old and slightly depressing hotel needs refurbishment Staff also need encouragement Most seemed like they wanted to be there didn t want to talk or assist Two exceptions one guy on reception was good and housekeeping staff were lovely and the only ones that smiled The pool was flooded owing to some kind of drain issue when I was there  Location good Area safe and close to central London Room spacious with natural light and ventilation 
 D cor is incredibly old they are not investing in any type of renovations Very basic channels offered on TV don t know why but really slow to load a channel Don t recommend to take the breakfast option it s very expensive considering what they offer Wifi in the lobby area is free but only for 30 minutes In the rooms you get 20 minutes per day and if you buy a voucher it s 7 pounds per day and only works for one device Overall I won t come back again in my next visit to London For sure there are better options than the Britannia with a better price  Staff was nice room was relatively clean location to my office was good Tried the Indian restaurant and it was very good 
 Car park not owned by hotel and day charges expensive no discount for hotel guests The hotel was nice and clean room clean river views in bar comfortable seating bar staff waited on tables
 Bed was quite hard but no problem as it was only one night stop over Excellent value for money Huge room Free tea and coffee facilities in room Quick check in and out
 The staff where incredibly rude and unhelpful The hotel was in an incredibly poor condition and it is disgraceful it is rated as a 4 star hotel The worst hotel I have ever stayed in while travelling the world for the past 25 years No Positive
 My partner and i and another couple booked 2 double executive rooms however our room was like a standard double and theres was amazing with a balcony Our bedroom windows were filthy dirty Went to the toilet and got locked inside it took my partner 20 mins to get me out Very unsafe if it was a child in there No value for money as this was a very standard room and could not make the most of the view as windows were vile The hotel staff were very polite just a shame the room was rubbish  The look of it when first pulled up and arrived 
 After two hours from checking out I noticed that I left one of my shirts in wardrobe Took my way to the hotel straight away Guess what My shirt was gone What am I supposed to say now I should ve sued the hotel seriously unfortunately I dont have enough time to deal with it Such a ridiculous experience No Positive
 Internet isn t free Front desk staff lack the right manner the Asian guy didn t have a good customer relations the way he passed the pen to me was very rude they don t explain anything to the customers Bed mattress is very hard and uncomfortable The room has no fridge Breakfast don t start till after 7 I had to leave early to catch early meeting so I missed breakfast  Not far from the tube station and has Tesco cross the road
 Staff told me to take the stairs with my suitcase not the lift without their help Very strange  Very clean room Room was serviced daily to a high standard 
 There was no window in my room but that was clearly defined in my booking which had its specific rate Perhaps window like portraits on the wall would be my suggestion to make the windowless rooms look less boring The bathroom could do with a modern refurb  The staff were very friendly and helpful I also enjoyed the therapeutic low key instrumental music that sieved through The rooms were clean The breakfast and dinner was superb I didn t have to go searching any where else for a decent meal in the area 
 the place was filthy despite me paying an extra 20 to upgrade to an executive suite only 2 teabags no coffee and 2 milk bathroom floor filthy bed was falling apart whole room dated and stank of smoke nothing at all
 The rude pompous staff and disgusting spa and dirty pool and gym broken doors and facilities Very basic boring over priced food Plus 1 bar and restaurant closed all the time  The room was okay
 Tele didn t work properly but didn t matter massively mattress was very hard but that s more personal preference than anything else Really friendly staff fantastic location Thank you 
 The plumbing in the toilet was poor Water did not drain away There were flies insects in the room coming though the aircon vent The front desk staffs were very slow during check in No Positive
 Nobody told me that my free upgrade which I had initially declined when it was offered at 20 00 was to a room overlooking a building site with all its incidental and early morning noise  The staff were friendly and helpful and subject to my didn t like above the hotel was good value for money
 The bed was really uncomfortable the tv signal was terrible and the room overall needed a facelift very old and tired Shower didn t work and the bath had flaky bits in it  Location great view from the room
 Bathroom was slightly dated compared to the rest of the room  We received a upgrade for free which was great of the staff We were happily surprised and loved the room views 
 Tired 4 star taxis service organised was very expensive I Will stick to using uber Shame about the construction work around the hotel much harder to get to the hotel from the underground  Reasonable location staff were helpful 
No Negative Excellent position of hotel to get to train station and dlr Many shops and good value restaurants nearby within walking distance Large clean rooms nice view over canary wharf dock Great value for money 
 Being able to get into the room without changing the card key THREE times would have been nice Popped out of the room at 08 30 on Saturday morning when the I returned an hour later 09 26 the cleaner had already arrived and was preparing the room for the next guest even though my room checkout was not until 11 00 No Positive
 Absolutely horrendous experience accommodation on the border of human dignity I was first shown a room without a window then after complaining I was given a room overlooking a noisy building site Two unusually thin single beds pushed together with a gap in between Room was not made everyday Barely enough soap for a single wash It was an awful and demeaning experience No Positive
 Shabby and tired public areas awful barn of a bar do not get fooled by the discount and rack rate if you pay 60 pounds then its good value  Great Location nice rooms
 This hotel routinely double books rooms We didn t check in until 11pm and like the other customer next to us at the reception desk were told that the type of room we d booked double non smoking was no longer available A little complaining got us a twin room with view where the beds were easily clipped together and the offer of complimentary breakfasts or a bottle of wine  Great waterside location Friendly staff and convenient for DLR
 Hotel is quite dated and in need of some attention  The reception staff were friendly and helpful Room service available until quite late in the evening 
 Breakfast is a disgrace there were Russian food queues they need a bigger space for breakfast Beds are very uncomfortable I had such a strange clean room There was an access to a huge terrace but that was also the housing area for air conditioning units weird light fixtures weeds cigarette butts just whacky  nice receptionist decent location but not easy to get to
 Wi fi was only in lobby and for only 2 20 minutes sessions per day Had to pay 4 pounds to use the pool Staff said they would give a box breakfast since we were leaving before breaksfast started and we had breakfast included in our room rate but night before leaving staff didn t know what i was talking about They said to hang the room service tag on the door with what I wanted and night staff would have it ready at requested time Next morning there was nothing Went downstairs and staff didn t know what I was talking about  Large room by London standards 3 eating chices within hotel 
 Thought the 63 3 night motorcycle parking charge a bit steep to say the least will visit this hotel again probably but if travelling by motorcycle may be tempted to look elsewhere if cheaper parking offered  Had a nice 3 night stay recently in this hotel combined a bit of London sightseeing along with a wembley rugby final the hotel has a bit of old charm about it even though its not that old in the modern canary wharf area which is also good for night out with plenty of bars and eating places 
 Very tired decor in all areas of the hotel Eg wall paper throughout paint on surfaces age of decor and carpets very worn  Great service from reception conseiarge to bar staff Very happy 
 The gym was a little tired looking as was the room I was not happy at having to pay the 20 upgrade as the room I had booked wasn t available I didn t want to make a fuss at the time but I do not find that good customer service Also breakfast was not good value for money  The size of the room and bed
 The property was looking very tired and could do with a bit of TLC you can tell that it used to be a very nice property but it is looking like it needs a good spruce up  The bed was very comfortable and location was ideal 
 Lack of ventilation air conditioning in room A fan was provided but had it been warmer this would not have been enough  If you can put up with no window the 49 charge per night is value for money if all you need to do is sleep Very clean furniture basic but functional All usual equipment available hair dryer toiletries tv drink making facilities etc 
 Location nice but long walk from Canary Wharf tube station We did not use the dlr but this may have been closer  Staff friendly good facilities good room service nice area Can t fault hotel or staff and price excellent Very accommodating to our needs Upgraded room from no window to room with window complementary upon arrival 
 The booking was made by myself for my son The response of the staff and inflexibility in their manner was extremely disappointing They were not prepared to accept a cash payment for the booking and were prepared to turn my son away even though the room had been secured with a debit card They would not accept payment by phone with the debit card details and were very rigid in their approach I would not ever recommend Britannia Hotels to anyoneNo Positive
 The room was nice but was cold and noisey from the air conditioning kept me awake all night Picked up the phone to ring reception and it didn t work Plus you couldn t control the air conditioning from the room No Positive
 more coffee and tea deffo more milk  Bed was good view is nice area is nice and quite Price was very very good for area we payed 50 for one night as it was on offer 
 Our type of room had been over booked Arrived early evening and not enough staff on reception Bare minimum tea and coffee in room  Large room car park on site and close to tube and O2 
 You had to pay for wifi despite advertising complimentary wifi on the website Housekeeping ignored our do not disturb sign and walked into the room unannouncedNo Positive
 Booked double room got a twin room as told they had overbooked double rooms Waited 30 minutes for a pizza to be told ran out of cheese it isnt a 600 yard walk from Tube Station as stated in description  Location was good
 The wifi did not work in the room Apparently we would have had to pay for it if it did which was unpleasant The shower didn t work properly we had to burn ourselves as the cold water was not working The swimming pool is not free there is a fee which was super uncool as we have been misled into thinking it would be free  The room was fairly big
 Nothing to dislike about the hotel It was lovely to have a fan in room as it was very hot and it keep room nice and cool during the night Beds were comfortable and clean 
 It s certainly not a 4 hotel it s very much a 3 hotel so selling themselves as a 4 is definitely pushing it In our room there was a huge amount of noise coming from our ceiling like a grinding fan or something that made it very hard to sleep Furthermore the room service was rude and poor I called up with no response so thought I may have entered the wrong number When I called again I had an angry lady on the end of the phone who told me that We re busy so maybe you should have thought that s why we didn t pick up your call When the food was delivered to the room it was poor and not as described on the menu  For the price we paid approx 180 for 3 nights in a double room this was a great location The room was clean and well kept 
 Staff were rude attitude was all wrong I called for room service was on the 11th floor as my wife was not feeling good they hung up the phone 3 times very unprofessional service Would NEVER RETURN AGAIN Beds and bathroom were clean
 Frayed carpets in the hallway 60 s wallpaper Grants whiskey bottle left in the corridor Chipped tables in the room with missing handles Temperature advisories on the taps missing Shower holster falling off the wall Double bed in what was told to be a twin room Window we couldn t close considering there was an air vent outlet directly outside our window Air conditioning unit that did not work past setting 1 Location
 We was placed into the new part of the hotel which felt far to small and didn t feel like i was in the Britannia we stayed there previous for a lower rate but had a lovely room however this time we was charged a 20 fee to change room But we found out later after having a drink with another couple in the bar that they paid for exactly same room as we did but was upgraded to a suite with a jacuzzi free of charge This was very upsetting as I don t think we was treated fairly When I questioned it with the hotel staff I was told there was nothing they could do and didn t even have time to care for us or maybe just offer us out 20 refund back It s a shame as we always choose to come here We was told that the hotel is under new management and they don t offer different rooms anymore but yet I knew otherwise as the other couple we met confirmed that the staff was lying To us The breakfast wasn t as nice as before either very dry and bad quality Wasn t worth paying 10 each We went there with the intention of staying for 2 nights but chose to stay else where after being treated unfair we opted for the Hilton next door  The authenticity
 We were in a windowless room and the only air seemed to be this little fan which couldnt cope in the heat Also to get to the room which was an odd number was like a maize and took forever going up and down stairs and around corners even though was meant to be first floor The coridor had a wooden sound when walking and you could hear every step also a few nights there were kids and teens running up and down The parking garage also is a place to avoid expensive and dingy and you actually have to walk up the same drive you drove in on  We had a room with no windows they had a giant mural painted on the wall which gave the illusion of space and a window so helped with the claustrophobia Also had a nice seating area The room was very clean 
 Paid extra for a window but view not good Bed a bit lumpy so it took a while to get to sleep Not enough shower gel etc in our room for two Only two tea bags Only 20 mins of free internet  It was quiet 
 Being told we were in a new room with no window then asked if we wanted to pay 20 to upgrade to a room with a window which we refused We were then given a room with a view but it was extremely dated and the shower wasn t at all powerful or temperature regulated  Good location
 Short changed by 20 pound when getting our deposit back Still haven t had a response for our complaint which was 1 month ago  Loved the air conditioning and gym and pool 
 Noisy neighbours having a screaming orgasm Day and night Quite funny actually  A lovely Hotel friendly staff Nice and clean and the bed was really comfortable Will be back very soon 
 culture of staff priorities over customer e g interupted by staff by continual knocking on the door of my room at 23 15 with a bill query which was down to their error Negative notices everywhere Food very poor quality shower cuts off hot water after a few minutes lots of sofas in a very large ground floor area Large room with comfortable bed 
 construction work next to the hotel meant lots of noise bed has seen better days springs were coming through the mattress parking is an absolute rip offNo Positive
 No air con in room no breakfast provided for those doing Ride London Customer services are now regusing to communicate and are renegading on their own duty managers offers of compensation  Car parking
 Location wasnt convenient as there were construction work near the hotel and we had make a big detour The furniture were old and the place obviously needed refurbishment  Room was spacious
 Would have liked free Wi fi breakfast Included Herbal tea or decaf finales coffee some biscuits bottle of water would be more welcoming  Bathroom toiletries close proximity to tube DLR 
 That we had to leave our lovely suite  The staff were absolutely lovely Whilst some people think the decor is slightly outdated I think it actually adds to the character of the hotel They weren t very busy when we were there and they upgraded us to an amazing junior suite at no extra cost 
 Staff were not cooperative and didn t keep the promise made to us and then tried to kid us we had been given an upgrade when I was given exactly what it was I had booked originally Have stayed a few times before but never againNo Positive
 Very busy and check in out was not as easy as it should have been While the hotel was comfy the location was a complete building site all around  Efficient staff with a comfy hotel 
 Dated poorly maintained bedrooms need complete re fresh re decorating v poor for a so called 4 wouldn t recommend This hotel is of a 2 standard It must of been awarded the rating based on facilities which are at additional cost if used nothing
 When I arrived I was told there was no room available a room was eventually found however I had to request a change of room at 2am due to the noise from the air conditioning I phoned reception to be told the system could not be switched off hence the room change  Ideal location
 The rail up to the actually room is unsafe for toddlers There was a misunderstanding about the breakfast in room rate which I dont know how did it happen but did spoil our trip Also the toiletries were very basic  The room was big and luxuriously built nice balcony views Spacious room comfortable bed dressing table and chairs It was nice
 too many three star quirks eg non refundable breakfast vouchers coach parties peeling wallpaper whilst appearing to be a four star would not stay again location
 The breakfast could be better organised  I liked the area nice and quiet but close to Canary Wharf Had dinner in the Indian Restaurant and myself and the wife enjoyed it and very reasonable 
 We booked two night in an Executive room No safe in room this is unbelievable The following were not working TV Pool Jacuzzi Very pool selection it tea for a 4 No Earl gray or green tea at all Old fashioned shower had to fiddle taps in bath We booked a 4 hotel as I have just lost my 19 year old son from epilepsy 6 weeks ago This was ment to be a relaxing trip But the jacuzzi was closed and had been for a wile Steam room so so dirty door on sauna did not close I fail to see how this hotel can say it s a 4 I work abroad a great deal I m in a different hotel seversl time a month So so disappointed Room was clean
 Hotel Parking was extremely expensive When ordering room service I requested to swap topping on pizza and was told it couldn t be done Not particularly friendly  Great views of the city
 The bath was broken and had no plug the beds were very old and outdated I wasn t given the room I booked and the windows are all screwed shut and the wallpaper was torn in quite a few places and you had to tilt the kettle to boil itNo Positive
 The decor in the common areas was very bland and did not reflect the image of the hotel  The main reception and bar areas were very grand This was a pleasant surprise on arrival 
 Room was very dated poor carpet condition towel dirty and tap top missing  Breakfast staff very friendly Reception staff mixed one kept us waiting for no apparent reason however another member at reception very friendly 
 Staff in restaurants one staff Asian guy really rude but rest of staff good Seemed to be not bothered about customers More interested in pickup up food and close quickly Location that s about it
 Facilities no hot tub not been used for months Same with treatment rooms Staff were embarrassed by lack of facilities claiming people don t use them Location is amazing Indian restaurant staff were brilliant
 Room had no windows we could ve upgraded but this was costly breakfast not included in the price and the cost of breakfast per person was very high Other guests talking outside our bedroom at 5 45 am LOUDLY as the corridors are tiny  Hot food available until 1 30am whilst cold food available all night Central heating and hot water
 The bill was a lot more than expected I used the express checkout so did not have a copy it came to 836 I stayed for 2 days which was at 100 per day 200 I did hot spend another 600 on food and drink please look into this for me and report back Staff were good helpful
 Given the size of the room the TV was too small Would have liked a couple of extra sachets of coffee sugar milk  A nice big room Plenty of space to move around 
 Everything is extra You have to pay to use the hotel pool the hotel gym the hotel internet  Staff were very helpful and attentive even when extremely busy 
 Trim and furnishings starting to get a bit tatty a shadow of its former glory I think There is a smoking floor floor 2 that stinks I was shocked to learn they allow smoking in the hotel  Great location for Canary Wharf 
 D cor very dated poor facilities in room radio lost signal frequently no biscuits offered with tea coffee bathroom toiletries very minimal and functional These things cost nothing to improve Location we got a very good online price plus upgraded when checked in
 Poorly designed hotel for mass market coach parties The room furniture was dated and uncomfortable 1960 70s seats too low and plastic coated coffee table too low and too small Badly designed hotel floor layout two sets of of steps on the floor to the room from the lifts I was on the first floor Too many steps down into and out of the room The bath was too small and narrow Curtains large and heavy and difficult to open and close Lifts far too small for the size of hotel and too few only 3 The Pizza in the pizzeria was inedible and expensively so  The water pressure on the shower and controls were good Leaving 
 The manager at hotel is rude he doesn t understand the customers Because of his behavior next time I will not stay at this hotel  Cleanilyness
 Some of the check in counter staff were rude and unhelpful The manager made up for them and was very nice to bad that the others don t follow her lead  The place has clean The water view from the bar area was very nice 
 The mess of all the take away litter left in the lounge late at night which was obviously bought from the restaurant was an eyesore  Location comfort and friendly staff was awesome 
 bed so uncomfortable springs sticking in me if your going to use cheap mattress use bed toppers Old tired hotel but quite good position big room big bathroom good view nice pizza bar 
 Shame about work going on right beside hotel Place a little dated but we enjoyed it Wifi limited this is dissapionting nowadays Location good and spacious rooms for London
 Everything about the hotel it s dated and being run down The facilities were all out of use or broken and no ladies changing room in pool due to a flood I won t be returning The Location
 My room didn t have a window when I asked for one I was asked to pay more money they did not provide me With parking unless I payed 80 pounds more then my room price one of the worst places I ve every Stayed in the double bed was 2 single hard beds put together an it was 50s old mattress Ido not advise anybody to stay here the worst customer service as wellNo Positive
 Tired bedroom with a musky smell Upgraded our room huge room but a tiny double bed Old rusty brass taps in bathroom Needs modernising  We had a balcony great view 
 Staff should be their to assist you give reasons for not helping with a request Facility were good and the staff were ok however as a regular stayer when requested a room with a larger bed no one wanted to help disappointed overall ok
 The customer service wasn t good they was rude they didn t understand Our room smelt so we complained and they said they would sort it out straight away but they didn t do it straight away  The hotel was nice but poor service Also hotel a bit old fashioned 
 Our encounter with the room service supervisor manager was very hostile He came knocking at our room to yell at my wife that the towels hotel supplies is complimentary and is not free flow Due to his hostile reprimand my wife has to invite him in to the room s toilet to prove to him there is only an extra set of towels supplied 3 sets in total Hey we just moved in after 20 hours journey we were very tired and need a good shower That s the reason we asked for an extra set of towels The attitude of room service manager supervisor suck  My wife and I have been regular guests of this hotel since 1996 The familiar decors and setting bring us back many good memories of staying in Britania at Canary Wharf 
 very very uncomfortable bed poor bed linen cleaner entered my room without knocking at around 8am Not impressed about having to pay a pound for a towel in spa area I asked for a cab for my meeting and they provided their own driver he went the wrong way and it took us over double the time necessary and charged us 12 for a 10 minute journey that took 25 minutes  pool was good staff in pool were nice 
 The staff who severed me was very rude and stubborn very poor customer service I was with my wife celebrating our 25years anniversary went very poor Room cleaner accidentally opened our room door twice so I don t no if that s accident  Room was nice the staff where not very good they looked they are stressing not good with customers 
 The staff at the restaurant Spice was not as friendly as it could have been and took really long as there were only 2 working  I was surprised when I entered this fancy grand hotel as I didn t expect this for the price It seemed really posh Later I saw the room and I think it s a luxurious hotel that lost a bit of value as it aged But still really comfortable 
No Negative Very pleasant and helpful staff Great location and very reasonably priced especially with its grand decor Very quiet at the weekend too would use this hotel again 
 Only ever had one or two night stays so nil to report here always fine  stayed here quite a few times with national holidays this was first time I booked direct Feels right comfortable for us good location too 
 At check in i was delighted to see the Spices Indian Restaurant and immediately made dinner plans The restaurant was very quiet and i perhaps i discovered why I ordered a glass of what purported to be Rioja and indeed it might have been but tasted like it came from a bottle which had been left half empty for days or longer On sending it back as off the waiter clearly disagreed with me but agreed to bring me a Shiraz instead which tasted remarkably similar to the supposed Rioja and similarly off So i reverted to beer and waited for the food To be fair the Masala Fish starter was ok However the lamb rogan reminded me of some sort of re constituted packet meal from the 1980s The type of meat i m assuming it was meat was indeterminate there was no evidence of spicy hotness and it was accompanied by a Peshwari Nan which had a vague sprinkling of something resembling desiccated coconut but nothing else It was without doubt one of the worst culinary experiences of my life My advice stay at the hotel but avoid the Indian restaurant  Nice room and an upgrade efficient check in good value 
 I asked for upper room smoking room even when I reached there I ask to manager for good room but he says next time so I didn t liked that coz I m regular customer Location
 Stained wall paper stains all over bedroom carpet shower hanging off the wall Had to clean my own table on two separate occasions for breakfast despite the table being dressed and ready to sit at Cutlery dishes and glasses covered in dishwasher residue both days Had pizza in the Italian restaurant expecting fresh chef cooked pizza Got ready made pizza bases not cooked properly with a bit of no friz toppings Headless to say we didn t eat at the hotel for the rest of the stay Have stayed in many 4 and 5 hotels in London and this was by far the worst experience I have ever had Staff were grumpy and constantly arguing in the breakfast restaurant  Location and proximity to amenities 
 There were not enough electrical sockets especially next to the bed there was a small drip in the bathroom from the ceiling  Room size was good descent mirrors and storage space view staff short walk from underground 
 buffet breakfast was disgusting Scrambled eggs where like porridge Apple juice was not apple juice it tasted full off sugar and colouring Over all bad way to start the day Rooms had 3 steps in them It says they have wifi on there web page it dosent say you have to sit in the foyer for free wifi or pay 7 pound per device in your room  i loved checkout knowing i was finally free off this hotel 
 We had to come in a company van and there was nowhere to park it Nobody seemed to want to help us and we ended up parking miles from the hotel and paying for taxis back and forth Very inconvenient  the decor was lovely and room was very comfortable 
 Having to pay 63 for 3 days parking on top of the hotel fees but it is London  Rooms nice and clean clean towels and bedding every day friendly staff and very helpfu 
 Given the star rating I felt it was a bit spartan in terms of furnishings active construction site nearby Ventilation was poor and on a warmer day this room would likely be uncomfortable  The room was very clean tidy surprisingly large I had a disabled friendly bathroom by the look of it Bathroom was extremely clean nice bath first time in a hotel I ever used one 
 There was no hot water either the night of arrival or the next morning I requested a quiet room and it was located behind the lift shaft I had to go to work the following morning very early hours so got little sleep A drawer frontage fell off when I tried to open the drawer No Positive
 I had booked an extra bed for a child and received confirmation of this but the hotel had not made up the bed and said they had no record of this from booking com I then needed to go back down to reception to pay for this immediately Room service had to be paid for there and then 5 30am and toast couldn t be provided before 6 30am extra charges for pool and spa with early closing times extra charges for towel hire for the pool Basically extra charges for everything a normal hotel would add these to the room for payment to be made at check out but all had to be paid for at the time Poor service  The hotel was in a good central location for the Ridelondon event
 The breakfast was just plain We found the room was a bit tired looking Scuffed furniture holes in wall from a picture once there  The bed was comfy Reception looked great Everything worked 
 Aircon fan was a tad noisy in the room carpets in the stairs were a bit past their best Parking a bit pricey but it is that London  Good room great location for our event Ride London Surrey Nice clean room bright despite no windows did book knowing no window 
 We were very pleased with the upgrade but was very disappointed with the bed hard and uncomfortable Not a very good night sleep  Great location for the purpose of stay London cycle ride On web site car parking was available but the area was small spaces very narrow and difficult to drive around We enjoyed the room upgrade 
 No free wifi in the room The shower was a bit difficult to adjust to the right temperature The staff is professional but not friendly Check out time is 11 00 There is a charge for all extra s Like the left luggage etc  We were upgraded to a suite Probably because of our early check in The hotel is a bit old fasioned You can see it Use to be high profile in its early years No free Wifi in the room but only in the comfortable spacy lobby Location is good but the excelent view will soon disappear behind new buildings
 Cleanlinees poor dirty and dark in places needs re furbished and brought up to date Travel Lodge allot cleaner ammeinties water in rooms the hotel charged for everything from a window to a bottle of water a towel 1 and use of Gym another 4 and so on  Not far from DLR and work
 I have stayed at the hotel numerous times this year due to locality of my workplace It is normally a reasonably priced hotel with a comfortable stay Unfortunately on this occasion my stay was awful the toilet in the room had a disgusting smell of smoke which seemed to come from a balcony on the 13th floor This was constant with the air con not making any difference the bed was terrible and was on the verge of breaking This will be my last stay here I will be taking my custom elsewhere No Positive
 The bed I slept in was making a funny noise each time I turned in the night I could here the noise of springs coming from the bed frame or mattress also the windows are not double glazed properly I could hear the noise from the passing DLR trains and the birds in the river  The room we stayed was clean and the bathroom was amazing and it had white towels and bed linen The hotel is a short distance from the train station so commuting is easy 
 The internal hotel air conditioning fan was very noisy and as far as I could see no way to turn it down or off  The small single room with no window that I had booked wasn t available due to a flood They therefore upgraded me to a much larger room and gave me a free glass of wine for the erm inconvenience of having my room upgraded Can t say fairer than that 
 Parking was very very difficult in the car park needs to be looked at as collisions in there are inevitable  Staff were welcoming and friendly rooms were comfortable and clean 
 Terrible uncomfortable matress bathroom really needs upgrading and modernisation Filthy Windows and badly maintained lifts  Location excellent for working in Canary Wharf Room relatively quiet 
 the old dilapidated state of the property internally It is like an old man ready to die there is a very major construction next door and one can not avoid seeing that everyday from their windows I am sure the building is due for a rebuild anyway  The hotel is very old and what you see on the internet was possibly taken 20yrs ago as it does really show present status of the property today FALSE ADVERTISING The staff are very good doing the best under the circumstances 
 Terrible attitude from the staff They were very rude and disrespectful Need to be more clear on what is included within the price  The rooms where were clean 
 All was good We were upgraded to 11th floor in a suite which was a lovely surprise and made our working visit to canary wharf a very enjoyable experience Thank you
 Would of been nice to of had a double mattress not two singles with a double sheet Couldn t believe I could not get a coffee from the bar in the evening  Good location And clean room Very impressive ascetics
 No free wifi inside the rooms Don t provide any charger Telephone in room didn t work at all Couldn t even use the tel to call reception  Fair price Provided toothpaste and toothbrush Express check out was awesome 
 Hefty parking charge 15 00 to keep my car over night but besides that everything else was great  The service the look of the hotel the size of the room nice big spa bath in bathroom Nice view of the city 
 Bed really hard and you could feel individual springs Good quality mattress topper would probably sort this hotel manager Heating only seemed to function to cool the room and no matter what we did it seemed to stay on 16 5 degrees i e too cold  Really good value booked only one day before Really large rooms with two nice armchairs and spectacular views 
 Rooms needs some TLC Breakfast should be included in the price but for what we paid they should have provided more fresh fruit better quality juices the apple juice was extremely sweet  The feel of it
 Towels tea bags and wifi I find it incredible that hotels of this standard cannot provide larger towels and decent tea I m equally amazed that in this day and age there is a charge for wifi in rooms I ve stayed in many hotels abroad and many of a lower standard and rating than this where wifi is free in all areas I took a special offer of a reduced rate on windowless room The electric fan provided relief but why doesn t a hotel of this standard have AC anyway  The location apart from the awkward walk from tube DLR stations around building works is very good 
 The hotel is very tired and tries too hard to be something it isn t Wifi is very poor and tends to be big bus parties who use it Cheaper and better elsewhere if you are just visiting London  Location 
 Staff rude and when I continuously refused to accept a room without a window they became aggressive to the extent that I said I would call the police Booked a room with a window and on arrival was told they had none available so was told I had to have a room without a window I refused and eventually had to pay to upgrade to a twin room which was a smoking room and stank 
 The non disponibility of the net favilty at the room it to have be free all the time  The location of the hotel visa a vis transports facility metro bus 
 Parking could be cheaper  Great hotel fantastic Indian restaurant 10 10 breakfast excellent our 2nd stay and will stay again great value for money 
 The bedroom was musty and not that comfortable They charge 15 for car park per day and it is not mentioned on the booking details  Hotel is in a good location for business and easy access to most of City via the docklands railway 
 Your indian restaurant was a disgrace the food wasn t what is said and the staff there wasn t helpful at all The bed was very comfortable set against the water very relaxing
 The only complaint I have is that the coffee in the room could be more than just 2 sachets and a better quality coffee We got upgraded to the penthouse suite without asking which was brilliant the view was brilliant and the room big and airy
 Tissue box in the bathroom not sure if it was supposed to be some sort of paper origami but didn t look good also TV wouldn t work that well not sure if remote batteries maybe running out  Loved the rooms very high standards always cleaned and tidied daily to high standard would recommend
 No ventilation in the bathroom Not enough insulation so we can hear noises outside the room Free wifi is only half an hour day and poor signal in our room No outdoor sitting area  The bed is comfortable The room is clean 
 Beds were comfy but was given 2 single beds put together Not comfortable at all for a young couple as one or the other kept slipping in between so a bit of a sleepless night No long mirrors Extra Towel and extra pillows request ignored Felt not at all value for money 2nd room views of roadworks and building Not good as was booked for a footballer player His bef was also 2 singles  Bathrooms clean Room clean Good breakfast Excellent view from my room 2nd room booked as was entertaining a new UK signed football player His room was better than ours but i guess it better he had the better one 
 Their Staff could be a little better trained and maybe try to be helpful rather than just simply ignore other guests or brush them off It wasn t as bad as I d expected reading all of the reviews 
 There are newer rooms on the ground floor that don t have windows they are not uncomfortable but I wouldn t want to stay in one longer than a night  The hotel is like an old rich lady that s seen better days think of Blanche DuBois from the movie Street Car Named Desire Yes its a bit tatty and frail but you can see vestiges of it s former glory around you Huge bath tub that isnt environmentally friend but very comfortable High ceilings and lots of space in the public areas Big windows letting in lots of light Staff making up for it with bigger smiles but with a hint of yes we know I d stay here again 
 One of the worst places I have stayed They have a gym but it is not included in the price Give breakfast a miss Bring your ear plugs for the train and construction Avoid talking to the staff don t worry that the place is falling apart and you will be fine  Location
 Upon my arrival I was given a room without windows even though my reservation was for a one with windows 130 GBP per night After my complaint I was told that I booked a room without windows even though that was not true After all they apologized and provided a room I booked but it was very cold wasn t clean and there were moths in the towels  Location
 Room decor is rather tired It s central London so it s quite noisy at night though that iis hardly hotel s fault Relatively inexpensive for the area  Ideal for family event in Canary Wharf area Parking available Arranged requested room with disabled facilities for my mother and receptionist quickly arranged for all three rooms for family members to be on same floor next to each other 
 One particular member of staff a trainee lady is rude inconsistant with information and dismisive I also dont like the fact that when you book a smoking room they try and charge you extra  The location 
 Other reviewers described this hotel as tired I would add shabby and mediocre You have to pay for WiFi in your room they advertise free WiFi in the lobby but this is only 20 minutes day and doesn t seem very reliable It s clear that maintenance is not a priority at this hotel for example some genious replaced the toilet seat in my room with a larger model that prevented the bathroom door from opening fully the paintings were hanging from a single nail the windows in the bar looked like they hadn t been cleaned all year The room furnishings included a dressing table in front of the window with a mirror that obscured most of the view The pizza at their Italian restaurant looked and tasted like frozen takeout the house wine was undrinkable I would stay here again if there were no other options but I would spend as little time in the hotel as possible there are lots of restaurants and cafes nearby with free WiFi and really good food  Convenient to Canary Wharf which has good rail and tube connections to the rest of London Really comfortable bed 
 Bed was very uncomfortable Felt the springs in the mattress We only stayed one night cause we had to get a flight early next morning But everything was great for our short stay Lovely big room
 Had to pay for parking  The check in was fast and smooth They upgraded me to a better room which was lovely and spacious The room was clean and staff were kind and helpful 
 The furniture is old and in the room was a smell from smoking and no window was opening Our reservation was changed I have reserved a different room and when I was there they said that is no longer available  The price was fair
 Room decor was a little tired as was the bathroom The main reception area smelled like a swimming pool on Tuesday  Close to my place of work and to local restaurants 
 The furniture was old and tired getting close to shabby The restaurant food was poor For a London hotel next to Canary Wharf I would expect much better facilities Clearly at some point this had been a good hotel but it hasn t been updated for a long time all it will take is one good large hotel to open nearby and this hotel should lose almost all it s custom The rooms were clean Hotel was fairly quiet The staff were nice 
 The rooms were falling apart The bed had bugs I was bitten on my leg The toilet seat kept falling down and smacking into my back whilst I was engaged The room was in dire need of decoration The hair dryer blew up There was a huge pool of water on the window sill The restaurant staff had no idea what gluten free meant and I am convinced that my gluten free toast was cross contaminated somewhere in the kitchen But apart from that  It was in a good location for the meeting we had the next day 
 This is not a modern hotel nuts very tired old hotel My room was a large cupboard in the middle of the hotel the bed uncomfortable with poor old linen and a toilet attempting to flush all night long The staff are unfriendly and disinterestedNo Positive
 I disliked a lot of things i must pay the gym while it was not visible on the website that it would come on top i saying that the wi fi is included is not correct with your customers as you only benefit from 20 minutes for free not sufficient at all when you travel for business reasons iii average low breakfast e g not even a single fruit  Nothing
No Negative Spa facilities should be cleaner in need of renovation all else was great thank you staff was very nice especially the asian girl which allocated my room
 The wifi in the room is on chargeable basis per day The furniture in the room looked old and worn out I wanted to have just eggs for breakfast which they didn t serve in the restaurant  The check in was quick The room was nice and clean The bathroom had a tub Room had iron and an iron table which was useful 
 Brighter furniture and more up to date facilities in the bedroom also the congestion around the hotel road closures made it hard to get to The central location lovely bedroom size
 Beds were a little narrow and hard and the underground car park is a little bit tight in terms of space  Whilst the hotel is not in central London the Tube Station is only 5 minutes walk away The hotel whilst an older building was immaculately kept The food and service in general was excellent
 The staff was never rude but also the lady didn t bother to smile at least once  The hotel was really nice well located and clean Even though it could use a makeover because is a little old the maintenance is really good 
 Safety and complete lack of help from the hotel staff We were robbed We came back to our room to find out that my laptop the charger and our cash were nowhere to be found Unfortunately that was not the worse part The horrible reponse of the manager of the hotel was unbelievable  Nothing 
 They offered a room without windows I thought this was not possible in Europe Took them forever to check me in consistently bad as I was in this hotel already one year ago and had to wait ages for checking in Wifi free only in the first hour in the room never going back sorry The tea pot in the room Basics in UK 
 Insects all around the room dirty bathroom air conditioning was not use full at all wouldn t recommend anyone to get a room in that hotel Stay away l No Positive
 The service in the dining room at Breakfast was not as good as previously there was no fruit left apart from prunes and when I asked for some was told it had all gone also the table hadn t been cleaned properly However when I went back to the service bar after complaining I found that the grapefruit had been replenished otherwise the breakfast was good The room was nice and big the bed very comfortable and I slept well
 Italian restaurant Don t go there  A hotel in need of significant investment and an awful Italian restaurant Otherwise pretty comfortable It would have been good in its day Some staff could do with a crash course in customer care and I suspect many others behind the scenes work very hard 
 We got a room as big as a closet Which was anything but clean After complaining at the reception we were given another room which was larger This was fortunately fairly clean Otherwise the room was old and everything was in need of replacement The carpet was replaced with other pieces Not a hotel to get a return No Positive
 There was construction going on in the area Well that s typical for London but would ve been nice to know ahead of time The beds were very hard shower was not very clean black stuff in the grout of tiles The cleaning staff woke us up trying to come clean the room at 830 9 and 930 The hotel is beginning to look very aged including the decor  Despite construction the staff were able to move our room to somewhere quiet And of course the price was very good for London 
 Credit card didn t work at ceck in at 2 00 am in the morning The manager in charge who was very rude and unfriendly refused to let me check in and asked for cash to get at the machine in the hotel which didn t work Hotel manager insited to talk to my bank to get the OK for check in at 2 30 am which took another 30 minutes due to connection problems Finally I made it with the same credit card to get cash at a nearby NatWest cash machine Totally inapproriate behaviour of manager the two receptionists ecxused for manager s behaviour which was extermely unpleasant for all involved Breakfast starts at 7 00 am which is a problem for business people or guests who need to leave early in the morning  Nothing hotel in decomposition 
 the room was tiny outdated and breakfast was cold rubbery and I was there at peak time not as about to close Overall value for money was appaling  reception looked fancy
 though the area is a little far from oxford leicester sq etc 9 min walk from canary wharf tube the price for such a spacious room and in a good area plenty of places to eat
 a fridge in the room would be nice The hotel is spacious but still very cosy many seating places downstairs nice views the rooms I had are big and stylish Very silent I would definitely recommend it 
 Check in took too long hotel is getting old and threadbare needs maintenance Condensation from AC drips on you when in bathroom and leave puddle on floor Loose wire socket by the bed Carpet dusty Bed so uncomfortable whichever way I turned spring would lodge in my side Awful nights sleep before a very important meeting Went to reception to speak to manager was stuck behind an equally annoyed couple already complaining didn t have time to wait to speak to him On the way back from breakfast having to step over dirty bedsheets just thrown from peoples rooms into the corridor bizarre Probably the worst hotel I have stayed in EVER Shocking this is canary wharf Hotel needs to wake up or drop its stars and become a hostel Avoid  Only the location good for meetings locally
 Room could do with a little TLC maybe  Great hotel great location friendly staff and even got upgraded free of charge to a jacuzzi suite will be returning 
 The spa was subject to an extra charge even for guests and you were expected to use your room towels which was strange and left you with wet towels in the room I don t expect a hotel of this size and standard to not have wifi throughout and annoying that they also limit access to it For goodness sake in this day and age wifi should be available free of charge in all hotel rooms It is very shortsighted as the hotel lost income because rather than stay in the hotel I went to a cafe in Canary Wharf for an excellent breakfast and lunch because not only was it cheaper but mainly because there was free wifi There were extensive building works going on next to the hotel which meant that there was a lot of noise from diggers and demolition work from early in the morning so even though I was on holiday it wasn t very relaxing and impossible to use the room during the day I know the hotel couldn t help this but maybe a warning about it and an option of a room on the other side of the hotel might have been nice  The location is good and the hotel and the price was good The reception and concierge staff were very helpful 
No Negative everything about this hotel was perfect for our stay the staff are so friendly and helpful we got upgraded to a suit with an amazing jacuzzi bath I ve Stayed here 3 times since January for business and pleasure can t fault it 
 Mattress a little thin Wife found it hard I like a firm mattress so I was OK  Food in restaurants was good excellent All staff dealt with were friendly and service excellent 
 There was no butter with toast tea was cold Overnight parking rate to 9 00am so had to check out early or pay extra 6 00 Overall the hotel was tired shabby and not worth the high cost No Positive
 The bed was awfully uncomfortable and had springs coming through which caused me to wake up with bruising on my ribs may have just been a bad room Quite expensive for what it was  The location was good and the staff were friendly
 The room was not very clean there was a safety pin on the foor that I stepped on one of the cupboard was broken so bit disappointing The location was very good
 We had a window room which we didn t like in the end but this was our choice to save some money as we were only there for one night and wouldn t be in the room long Didn t enjoy waking up to pure darkness at 8 30am not having a clue what the weather was like outside Staff could be a bit more cheerful on check in  Perfect location to get to from o2 Tube nearest is nearby Canary Wharf so accessible anywhere There are leisure facilities but we didn t use them Bar on site we took a drink to our room whilst getting ready to go out 
 Noticed AHU s outside a bit noisy on arrival but after a drink TV on didn t need any rocking to sleep  Great Breakfast shame I couldn t stay longer
 The fee for the gym facilities Concierge didn t carry all luggage No designated smoking area bar out the main entrance WiFi fees should be free  The British style The comfort 
 Decor slightly dated but does not affect the stay  Excellent value for money and very accommodating when we were let down last min with pre booked apartments There were 8 of us down to watch Lionel Richie and was let down gone 4pm so thank you Britannia 
 Noise levels from the DLR line Lack of cold water trickled out of the taps when turned on full hard matress food served within 4 minutes  location close to offices 
 The room was a bit scruffy and there was a slight smell of damp windows were dirty No wifi in room  the location the view spacious room friendly staff loved the layout downstairs 
 The hotel is worn out and shabby through and through with a dated 80 s decor It s as if they re waiting to redevelop Suits me at the price  Good value for money
 Staff are very miserable and never smile or acknowledge your presence Restaurant shuts early in the evening despite being advertised as open till 9pm  Smoking bedrooms 
 everything else Very old and tired hotel food quality was extremely poor and breakfast was so bad even though it was included within the 4 nights I stayed there I ate out for two of them as it was so bad  location was not too bad
 The croissants were dry and stale You use poor quality corn flakes juice bacon etc The mushrooms were canned not fresh Very poor value The restaurant staff in Indian restaurant provided poor service Only two people and yet i was seated by a pillar I was also asked how I would pay before I was seated Disgraceful I left and went to the Italian which was fine  I have stayed here at least once a year for the last ten years and highly recommend it for service position and comfort I was fortunate to be upgraded to a delightful room Some of the smaller rooms are not so good It can be expensive unless you can get a good deal There is no loyalty system to encourage repeat visits An Ibis us being built opposite so Britannia will need to offer some deals 
 General condition of hotel dirty windows run down condition of pool surrounds steam room and in particular changing rooms very poor  We were given an upgrade on arrival to a suite
 The food in jenny s restaurant was not at its best as I m sure constantly cooking the same food over an over must affect a chefs passion over time im not sure but the hotel had several restaurants to chose from so wasn t all bad  Everything was amazing but the only negative comment I could possibly have was that the food was not what I guess I expected wasn t what I expected when told it was a carvery but many other choices to pick from Other than that it s the best hotel I ve ever stayed at and my sons 16th birthday treat was amazing and he simply thought the hotel was a palace xx
 Almost everything the hotel needs an urgent renewal the furniture were super old and they were in bad state the bathrooms belong to other times and the carpet was old and FULL OF DUST Besides all the doors made of wood were totally scratchy The communal rooms and swimming pool were always crowded and to be honest taking into account the state of the rest of the hotel we didn t dare to go into the swimming pool Besides the communication with the rest of the city is not the best one  Not much to be honest The only point at favour of the Hotel is that they have an Italian restaurant open till 1 00am in the night so if you are hungry you can go there to ask for a pizza only pizza not pasta and take it to your room because you are not allowed neither to have lunch in the restaurant after 21 00pm 
 The sports bar was a little dated and the food wasn t great But a short walk away and you will find restaurants We only had food in the sports bar They have an Indian and Italian restaurant so I wouldn t know what that foods like  Pleasantly surprised by room very fancy with a nice suprise of having a balcony Staff were lovely and in a great location for transport Around the corner to underground and the DLR Also great location if your traveling to the O2 for the night which we were When we first opened out door we were met with a metal staircase which lead to up to our room Lovely little touch 
 Not a lot of cold water pressure in shower Small plate for breakfast Need bigger  The staff in dinning area for breakfast were very happy helpful A pleasure to meet Bed very comfy Love being on waters edge 
 Air Conditioning could not be adjusted because it is centrally controlled It was being run at 25 degrees C in Summer Couple that with windows that cannot be opened unless maintenance gets involved with a spanner etc and you have a stifling bedroom Then although advertised over the desk at reception the so called 24 hour room service availability does not exist Tried many times to phone them but no answer Then tried via reception and still no answer  Location is good if a little too noisy 
 The shower temperature could not be regulated and was extremely hot The bathroom as a whole was dated and in need of updating  Room comfortable and clean albeit a little dated Breakfast was good and food freshly prepared Checking in and out was good with little waiting time
 The staff in the breakfast restaurant rude Mix up with champagne and choclets meant I had to go and buy some my self spoiling the surprise for my fianc e The drunk people from the boxing causing problems meaning we didn t sleep well  We spent a long time looking for a hotel in London as we were getting engaged and wanted a lovely pace to stop 
 Believed to have breakfast as on website said included breakfast then when got there was not on confirmation Bed was very hard Decor in room scuffed  Location was fantastic
 Decorations were a bit dated and carpets were thread bear in places and had been half heartedly patched with non matching carpet Lifts took an eternity to come it was quicker to use the stairs Air conditioning was very noisy on medium and high speed which was reported to reception on Saturday evening but didn t get fixed Our room faced Dockland Light Railway so a slight rumbling could be heard when trains passed  Room was clean and very spacious with 3 comfortable beds Good all you could eat English breakfast
 All good for me Only minus was the fact that the occupants of the room next door had their TV on at top volume till 3am but this was not the hotels fault they cannot be expected to be responsible for inconsiderate guests Room was lovely big and roomy with all the things I needed When I arrived at reception coming in from a thunder storm the staff were lovely and welcoming and very helpful Used the concierge to get a car to my evening destination all done with no fuss and got me where I needed to be Express checkout perfect no delays on leaving
 Offered room upgrade to have a window for 20 When declined I found my room had a window anyway so could have been ripped off Cleaners barged into room while getting ready to have a shower slightly embarrassing and even came back a second time Room service called 3 times to ask about an order that had been cancelled unnecessary hassle very late at night  Clean comfortable room with tea coffee hairdryer and iron Handy location for the O2 arena near Canary Wharf underground station 
 Phone didn t work in room bath plug tough to remove Beds tiny Too soft Very dated and badly in need of refurbishment Carpets worn in some parts of hotel  Reception looks nice 
 service was shocking eberytime i rang reception no one answered my call i had to go down a few times to get service and saturday morning I rang and rang and waited in total of 10 minutes on the phone until i requested a call back  Location was excellent
 Wait to check in One male receptionist just left his female colleague to deal with a building queue Deserted aura to the place  Rooms are large Beds comfortable If lucky great views 
 Very unpleasant experience due to the lack of reactivity regarding payment options a simple authorization form from my company asked upfront would have avoided the threat of eviction on my second night Very poor hospitality from the hotel and especially from the manager passport confiscated and apologizes requested on my part after publicly humiliating me for not being able to charge the entire stay on my personal card 7 day wifi and cell reception not properly working in my room No Positive
 The beds were joined to make a double bed and were very uncomfortable The staff are not very friendly For a Britania chain breakfast should be included  The location was good 
 in contrast I felt that Breakfast was not welcoming and I only eat fruit in the morning and I obviously came 7 15 when the fruit had run out so only left was grapefruit and prunes  Food in the Italian restaurant was really good Staff were really helpful as I had recently broken my ankle and changed my room to be more accessible for me ie wet room bathroom Even though I have seen the review of this hotel have been less that favourable I have stayed in this hotel now 6 times over the last 3 months and will continue to as it is so close to Canary Wharf and as a female business traveller find it comfortable rooms are very well facilitated and staff very friendly helpful and welcoming 
 small bed and outmoded furniture lack of renovation good value for a 4 star London hotel although the location about 1 hour from central London and the lack of renovation justify the price
 Rooms was cold Windows felt paper thin Complained 3 times and got s fire and and extra blankets each time Instead of asking to to be moved rooms No great response from reception  Location was good
 Building works around the hotel make getting there at the moment a little complicated but once works have finished it will be brilliant  Room service was fab 
 Deciding not to partake of breakfast I attempted to return my 10 breakfast voucher Informed by the Manager that this is non fundable He was happy to loose my custom given the 433 00 bill I had just settled in favour of not refunding the 10 breakfast voucher Clearly not a customer focused facility  Good selection of restaurants the Indian serves particularly good food 
 the costs skyrocketed within a week from average 100 GBP to 320 GBP I had to vacate and find another accommodation That was too bad There is no fridge in the room The hotel charged me cancellation fee even when I checked in They were not able to track the customer checking in  The hotel is near to Canary Wharf The room where I stayed was comfortable 
 The internet in the rooms is free only for 20 minutes After that you need to buy a voucher or come in the hotel lobby to have free unlimited internet You would think you are living in the 90 when internet was a new thing No Positive
 Had a problem with the bath Initially we were refused an alternative room with a bath which I booked specifically  Leisure facilities were good however annoyed we had to pay extra for towels and were not notified when we asked beforehand that we should have taken our towels from the room
 to be honest the place could do with a lick of paint but this in no way detracted from the enjoyment of my stay  Friendly helpful polite staff Rooms clean and comfortable 
 The free wifi is only in the public spaces not the rooms which in this day and age feels a little ridiculous especially when many people will be visitors to the UK or on business so it s even more important The rooms and the whole hotel in general could do with a refurb and some investment into new wall paper lights new bathroom fixtures that have broken I wed surprised for a Britannia hotel they would let a room out that clearly needed some love There was also no warning on the amount of noise that would affect guests from the nearby developments as more luxury apartment blocks spring up It s the perfect location for me but not sure I could go back  The hotel has a great location and helpful staff 
 The receptionist was moody And not very willing to help She gave me and my husband 2 single beds then made it sound like she was doing me a massive favour by giving me a room with one double bed There was grout smeared all over the tiles in the bathroom and the milk for tea coffee had curdled so we couldn t have anything to drink AND they charge 21 parking on top of the already expensive stay The room was far too warm and stuffy And the shower gels were sooo tiny it wouldn t be enough for one person to wash  Bed was comfy and shower was lovely and powerful
 I was a bit concerned about the bathroom facilities as it seemed the plug wasn t working properly with the water draining at random though I made sure the plug was in Along with the tap area broken as when I used the shower Saturday and Monday morning water seemed to leak  The room was welcoming and cosy the bed comfortable and the everything about the room and bathroom was eye catching The view despite it being along the road side of the hotel was lovely to look down on especially when the sun was out 
 Over priced the hotel is cleaned and tidy but too run down for what they are charging  Liked the idea of how the hotel is laid out The staff are very friendly and helpful I cannot fault them in anyway they are a credit to their profession The location of the hotel is good even though its surrounded by building sites The surrounding building work makes access from Canary Wharf awkward and frustrating I loved the restaurants and swimming pool and I also think Friday s bar is a great addition to the hotel Even though the hotel is run down it s very clean and tidy And it does have some nice quirky features Like the Japanese statutes dotted around the place I loved them I think the sofas in the lobby are a nice and relaxing touch too while waiting for a cab or as a rendezvous point All in all its a nice enough hotel all be it a little disappointing when you consider what you are paying for it But it has the potential of being much better If a bit of money is spent on it Considering its in the heart of London s financial district I was expecting a bit more refinement The hot tub in my room was clean but but very worn out also the carpet in the room is old worn out I had a good sizeroom but could definitely benefit with a bigger TV with the options of sky channels However the nice big bed and the linen were fresh and comfy Theres a fantastic view from balcony of the docklands shame about all the building worksites at present it does spoil the view The room service menu is good and unexpectedly good value A mini bar and safe would be a great addition to the room Wifi should be free considering the price you pay for the room I loved the iron spiral staircase in the room another great quirky feature All in all a nice hotel that could be so much more if the owners are willing to invest a little cash and attention to it It is rather run down and in a desperate need of freshening up For this reason alone I think it was over priced 
 There wasn t any tooth paste We got upgraded so had the most amazing room with a stunning view the room was very clean and the bed very clean and comfortable I would definitely return highly recommended 
 Privacy Staff came just inside Tht wasn t expected  I liked that in hotel itself that there are restaurants and it s easy to dine Normally hotels doesn t have internal restaurants 
 The staff were not very attentive both the bar staff and restaurant staff did not know how to smile The service in the italian restaurant was poor there was just initially my partner and I eating we had to call the staff over each time we wanted to order and they did not bother to check if we needed anything Breakfast does not provide enough variety for vegetarians  The room was spacious clean airy and comfortable 
 The staff were rude incompetent and did not listen to us They charged extra even though a refund was given they made no effort to apologise for their mistake The hotel also takes quite a long time to respond to queries Completely unprofessional given that the location is in the heart of the financial district with a lot of business customers  Only positive feedback is this was close to where we needed to be 
 Very very old and tired in decor looks like it is living out its final days before new more expensive hotels take over Good value for money vs alternatives in area if all you are looking for is a bed
 No complaints Failure for money peaceful with no noises Amazing views very comfy bed would defiantly stay again Canary Wharf tube 5minutes away from hotel
 Location long walk from any station or from any activity shops etc Room shabby TV did not work properly and could not be viewed easily Wifi an expensive additional cost Bathroom tiny towels Noise from bathrooms in neighbouring rooms Check in very slow l  Breakfast was fine otherwise not much else to recommend 
 Very tired room condition Although in Canary Wharf and you can see it from station it is a good 10 minute walk to reach there with blocked roads Was allocated room on 2F over trash building site and facing DLR train and you can hear noise from 5am as trains rumble past  The price and spacious room for the price
 Very old and tired hotel lazy from Owners and the location deserves better It was tired when I stayed in the early 2000s not a penny has been spent since  Great views of the wharf BUT Has relied on its outstanding location to get away with not investing in upkeep of facilities
 the shower wasnt working properly the bed was terrible i always have this problem the double bed is made of 2 single beds with a massive gap in the middle i find this very annoying i liked the size of the room 
 I had a single room and the decor particularly in the bathroom was a bit tired looking Bed wasn t too comfortable either Mattress was ok but bed legs felt a bit loose  Location is good breakfast too My second stay here but room was not as good as my first stay I might be back if the price is right 
 Couldn t fault it  Staff were great and really welcoming from the beginning and fulfilled any needs we had over the weekend Love the design and decor of the hotel and it was excellent value for money Especially in the centre of London 
 Extend checking out time this could be really good if it happens  Friendly staff cleanliness comfortable bed well stocked bar good food and the location is quite convenient for shopping 
No Negative Amazing hotel The staff were lovely and extremely helpful Our room was booked with no window and they kindly put us in a room with a window It was very kind of them and I found the hotel extremely clean and comfy I royals deffo stay again The only downside is the area of where it was as it cost us 20 to get to the o2 area but that s not there fault I definitely would recommend 
 The fact that the cheaper rooms do not have a window is a bit depressing But the room is still decorated nicely Another downside is that we were on the ground floor and you could hear televisions on in other rooms and people walking down the corridor  The location of the hotel was quite convenient however it wasn t central enough But for what was paid the services were good and the staff try and be as helpful as they can 
 There could have been a couple more teabags and maybe some biscuits but that s not a major issue  I stayed just one night as I had an exam the next day and found the room and bed very comfortable I was even upgraded to a double room for no extra cost which was even better 
 The rooms do need updating and modernising Cleaners let themselves into the room early morning  I love the jacuzzi bath and balcony on the top floor I appreciate they gave me this room suite as it was a special occasion 
 there is a construction site just beside the hotel building waking you up very early the bath room wasnt the best shot of cleaning  the location at canary wharf the quality of the hotel
 The price is competitive that s for sure But it could have been much better with little effort I wake up at 8 am because the cleaning lady was ticking fiercely with someting metal on the door As she did around 8 30 and 9 And you can hear this ticking on other rooms quite well because the walls are pretty thin Anyway I felt I wasn t welcome after 8 am I would have used the Do Not Disturb card to avoid this annoyance The elevator capacity is not designed for large numbers of people After waiting over 10 minutes I took the stairs It would have been nice to open a window but that s impossible That s the way it is  Clean big room in a quiet yet business surrounding at a very reasonable price Underground at 10 minutes walk 
 WiFi chargeable after 20 minutes Tired look wallpaper damage and accessories broken or loose Breakfast was like a madhouse very little order  Convenient location Food not bad Staff Friendly
No Negative Love this place when I am in London When flying to from City Airport I usually choose this Hotel The Hotel is cleal the staff is friendly and efficient nice buffet breakfast Got upgraded again from a single room to a double room at no extra Charge Very good Price Spacious rooms with all you Need 
 They couldn t qoute on their preferred taxi service felt like they was taking advantage of tourists Booking com website incorrect on distance to the Shard further than suggested I work in the bedding industry the mattress was old and uncomfortable would have had a better nights sleep on the floor Should have stayed at Premier Inn  Parking
 I paid 120 to get room with A c it was tiny old room when told them Ac is not working they sent someone he came and told he can t fix it please open the window Lady who checked me in was friendly
 Cleanliness was just satisfactory The Italian restaurant was not good at all food average cleanliness poor and quite expensive Leisure facilities average and resented having to pay  Breakfast was good value 
 For the price breakfast could have been included not everyone is on an expense account  The room we were given was good nicely appointed comfy 
 The fact all the works around were going on Maybe a statement saying these was happening would have been good  We weren t expecting a window view but we were given one and it was a view down the river front 
 Nothing much only thing I d recommend is the bar is in a nice spot facing with windows on the Thames lights would of been nicer dimmed and some music on  Staff Lovely guy on Reception who upgraded us with great view Room was a good size for price paid 
 Bed was ridiculously uncomfortable Never slept all night tossing and turning The following business day meeting was a poor performance due to the previous nights sleep Will never visit this hotel again nor will I ever endorse it Absolute joke  Nothing really 
 The furnishing are quite old and dated the building work taking place is quite disruptive I was glad to be on a higher floor  Location was perfect for business meetings in Canary Wharf 
 Having to pay 8 for the gym and paying for wifi unfortunately the restaurant I wanted to go to at the hotel was closed It seems quite run down but is the cheaper option  I loved the size of the room and the Windows The gym was great too 
 No free wifi and speed of paid wifi not good The TV spontaneously turned itself on at 5 45am Dated decor and interior Convenient location in Canary Wharf
 The whole place is run down We got a big room at 7 floor where neither trouser press tea cooker was working Armchair was very worn and lockers was loose Internet did work intermittently so we checked our mails on a restaurant in Canary wharf Breakfast was the most tasteless I have experienced for long time I sent a jacket for cleaning it come back just pressed not clean The staff seems to be helpless or just fed up with the management they only said I am sorrry never fixed any problem I could also see the building had structural defects Might be better they tear the whole crap down and built something new with new management The whole atmosphere reminded me of Intourist hotels in Soviet Union This hotel is a disgrace for London  Location good close to Canary Wharf Underground B
 Many guests had traveled specifically for a concert Most of us got back to the hotel around midnight and this is where the problems began Firstly One of our group had to wait for nearly an hour to get served at the bar Room Service We had not eaten since lunchtime so were looking forward to getting a snack via room service at the hotel We tried three times each time we called we were redirected to a phone that never answered and just dropped your call after 5 minutes of ringing At this point I headed downstairs to bring this up with reception however I gave up on that idea after seeing loads of people already waiting there to complain about various things I made my way to the Pizzeria where the chef was on the verge of walking out Having his phone constantly ringing whilst he was unable to make a pizza as he had no cheese From the time I got into the pizzeria it took 20 minutes to get a drink and when I tried to order food I was told there were no orders being taken NOT HAPPY  Most thinks were awesome 
 All fine until I try to dry myself in the morning after my shower A small towel only you can t get round yourself So at check out I waited to be asked Was everything ok but she didn t So I said They forgot to put a bath towel in my room I couldn t get dry properly expecting some sympathy Oh all the towels are the same size she said The guest next to me suddenly piped up Yes I had that problem also She repeated the unhelpful non answer Talk about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory It can t save much money but worse was the fact my polite gentle complaint was not addressed I could be cruel and say she actually confirmed it wasn t an oversight that I couldn t get dry but deliberate policy Not happy with this  This hotel is getting much better I paid a little extra for a better room and it was really nice I stay in the Wharf often and the price is good but in the past the hotel has been tacky and unattractive many of my colleagues won t stay here but I was impressed I don t ask for much from a hotel I m asleep most of the time a clean bed quiet a good shower and light switches I know how to use So was really pleased Except 
 The carpark does not have enough spaces  The room I stayed in 108 was amazing Lovely view which my girl friend loved I would jump at the chance to stay there again 
 Little slow at keeping the breakfast buffet items filled up Paying for wifi Very squeaky bed  Nice and clean Room service was good even with the automatic 5 surcharge 
 Extremely uncomfortable lumpy bed in expensive Executive Room tinned mushrooms at breakfast meusli was very powdery Only 2 teabags in room no biscuits  very helpful staff nice smiles 
 Breakfast was a little disappointing it was fairly busy when we went down and the waiting staff were busy and although it was self service and our table was laid ready for use the coffee pot on the table was half empty and luke warm It was difficult to get anyone s attention to have it replaced and we didn t want to hang around  Was able to check in earlier than 2pm our room was also upgraded without extra cost Staff were friendly and accomodating Excellent location to transport facilities
 Bad beer served in the bar Accommodation is a little dated Expensive parking also with limited spaces Limited amount of towels provided Long que for check in even with 4 reception staff working Location Sauna both wet and dry 
 Not enough bar staff at end of night People queuing for over 30 mins when most of guests staying had been to a concert Also food quality for breakfast was very poor Food either over cooked or not enough choice No Positive
 I would like the breakfast price to be 10 even though you didn t buy vouchers at the reception  Transport location is perfect when staying at the hotel Its easy to travel to the city
 Breakfast over priced Parking extremely expensive Could hear the couple next door having sex walls were way too thin so was kept up all night Also no free wifi Tasteful decoration
 Staff service isn t poor Pizzaria  Very poor service and don t eat in the pizzeria food isn t good and service is frankly appalling When I Challenged a waiter about not opening a bottle of water he d delivered to my table he just walked away 
 Lack of air conditioning in rooms it just doesn t work Queues at check in  Amazing value for centre of Canary Wharf and have stayed there on a few occasions for that reason It s outdated but location just great We ve stopped staying there now due to the lack of air conditioning in the rooms It was okay in the winter but in the warmer weather it s been unbearable at night as you can t open the windows The staff are generally helpful but there can be a long queue at check in I also left an item in the room and it was never returned they said it wasn t there even though I made a special trip to collect it Luckily it was valuable to me but not irreplaceable 
 late checkout had a charge of 10 per hour after 10am decor wasnt to my personal tastes very vintage looking wallpaper and room furniture  In hotel restaurants served excellent food at a great price Staff were excellent and kind Room was extremely clean although decor was slight vintage style TV definitely looked out of place 
 There was construction going on when we visited and the windows let in a lot of noise The room was a bit dusty still and there was no ventilation to let out the steam from the shower  The staff seemed willing to help and friendly The room layout was nice like a Victorian room 
 There was quiet a loud noise like a pump running all the time in the room not the bathroom fan but like it  We were welcomed even though we arrived much earlier than we should have They looked after our cases foc after we booked out till the late pm We asked for a quite room and it was very quiet Very clean and fresh 
 1 WiFi is free for only 20 minutes day 2 No safe in room to keep valuables You can hire one at the reception if you want 3 No mini bar fridge in room 4 Freeview TV Are you serious 5 Cheap furniture full of scratches dirty carpets wallpaper 6 I paid 99 GBP per night NOT including breakfast 7 The room was overlooking a construction site the ugliest view ever I asked to change it for one with a view of the river but got rejected although the hotel wasn t that busy I wonder how this is a 4 star hotel I ve been to 2 star hotels which surely out rank this one  Location 
 Location slightly out of the way and a bit hard to access due to temporary construction but not hotel s fault  Very well presented room extremely clean with great furnishings 
 The travel distance to the excel centre rather than the distance it was the costs of travel that bothered me but I m just stingy  I didn t expect it to look so posh I felt so rich 
 Poor leisure facilities and building in and out is weathered Very disappointed in staff communication and made things difficult to book 1 When arriving at breakfast I was required to hand a card to enter I had to attend reception and then my room for I D to enter Breakfast 2 I arrive at 5 30 to check in and wanted to use you pool in which after checking in and dressing for the leisure facilities it was 6 15 which was too late 3 When arriving in the bar their was inappropriate behaviour by non residents which led to my partner and I retiring early to our room as we felt uncomfortable This was identified by your staff but continued to escalate 4 On arrival and checking in we were upgraded to executive double room This upgrade felt like a downgrade as it looked weathered and bare Looked nothing like your website Our balcony was shared with 3 other guests and had little privacy Very disappointed Apologies for poor feedback  Location was the only positive I experienced 
 Wi Fi must be free for 24 hours Today the first traveling custumers can do nothing without internet In my poor country offers this servise hotels that are to much modest than Britania Hotel  Comfort and cleaness
 Give me 2 single bed instead 1 double bed Was an uncomfortable night And it was only until 11 the check out for the price I think 24h is fair  Beautiful place lovely views 
 The carpet in the hallways was ripped in spots which surprised me for a hotel of its calibre  The hotel is quiet and easy to access Staff were good The room was well appointed 
 None of the hotel staff asked if me and my friends had a good time when we checked out They only collected the keys checked we were not owing and wished us a good day Also rooms could do with a bit of modernising Location and price Check in was straightforward 
 Room was grubby and outdated Air conditioning didn t work and they failed to respond to my request to address it twice On the third try they did change the room but the air con there was only marginally better  Location was convenient 
 I emailed you twice about parking and never got a reply I turned up on my Motor bike and found out I had to pay the same charges as cars which found really unfair I don t expect i will get a reply No Positive
 Old dirty hotel never renovated Instead of room with window they offer me a box without windows It cost me hard time to discuss with management and extra 30 minutes to wait their decision To find a room is real problem because of confusing numeration No free internet  Nothing
 Coffee was cold tea was help yourself to a mug and tea bag think there should have been a teapot  The room was clean shower was great and the bed was comfortable 
 The bed was two singles put together terribly uncomfortable and hard the room had a musty smoke smell woke up with a headache room had aircon that made the smell worse it was stifling no oxygen circulating and seriously not healthy for anyone This hotel needs serious updating and restructuring adding new windows that can crack open in all rooms I will never stay here again I would get a refund if I could prefer to avoid the hassle I will always remember how annoyed I was that it was money not well spent  Nothing 
 The air con in the room didnt work well It was too hot and we could not sleep at all  The bar overlooking the water was beautiful The food in the restauraunt was great The room was stunning
 The shower rail came down and hit my wife s head and when I complained stright away to reception all they did was send maintenance 45 min later The only time they responded quickly was when the fire alarm went off in our room due to the steam from the shower it was fairly small room 166 on the first floor And that was only because they thought we were smoking as they rang our room and asked just that It was fairly clean
 Really needs an update and the rooms are very tatty lots of scrapes scuffs carpets coming up the restaurants and food is a bit pub standard Given the location and exterior it should really be a spectacular place to stay  Quiet spacious big room good shower ideal location 
 Some of the facilities are a little tired but it doesn t take anything away from the room The AC in the room is a little noisy  Staff are friendly room has everything you could need Room upgrades are always nice too It gives you everything you need in a hotel room 
 Not convenient did not even have a charger when asked for Window was open resulting in a strong wind blow had to call twice Access to CW has also been reduced till 2020 resulting in a longer walkNo Positive
 Signage for bathroom need sign to say floor raised when entering bathroom Stick on notices could be on a different colour background There was no instruction on how to use heating controls  Room was very big enjoyed having the space to move around comfortably without bumping into each other Very good selection at breakfast very good price 
 The wifi left a bit to be desired Couldn t send an email anywhere in the hotel Would be great if wifi were free Towels were a bit on the thin side but did the job Windows could do with a clean but you have to take into account the amount of construction work that is going on in the area too Air conditioning in our room unfortunately did not work Too hot for us may be great for other guests Only stayed one night otherwise would have brought it to the attention of Reception  Didn t have breakfast Thought it was a little pricey Visited Tesco s adjacent to the DLR Bought some good Espresso coffee Camomile tea for me hot food and pain au vanille all for 12 50 This was the price per person for breakfast on the morning Would have bought at the hotel if a bit cheaper Good ambience Staff very attentive and professional Drinks were cheap at the bar Relaxing atmosphere Great location in the heart of Canary Wharf where its all happening Would recommend for business and leisure 
 Though I forgot to include my 3 months old baby in the booking but I was very disappointed when I was told while checking in by 1am that there wasn t any cotbed available for my baby I got even more disappointed when I discovered that use of the swimming pool wasn t included in the booking fee and that onsite parking cost 21 Also I disliked the fact that the room didn t have any windows  The reception area is spacious and quite comfortable 
 N A The staff were fantastic and the room was lovely and clean with very comfy beds The food was really nice and plenty of choice Overall a brilliant hotel 10 out of 10
 Our belongings were held to ransom at 1am as the check in staff had charged us an incorrect rate We were not even allowed to collect our belongings and leave until we paid more No Positive
 The hotel looks a bit old fashioned No hair dryer in the room No free wifi in the rooms  Large and comfy room with a nice view over the Docks Relatively quiet 
 For the price I paid I found everything good I just thinking can have other options of breakfast coz not everyone like to start the day with so heavy food  The room size is very good and very clean The hotel is old but don t smelling bad and I found the style romantic I took the cheapest room without windows and I had windows it mean just that you can t open who cares The English breakfast is not my favorite but my husband said is very good And there are good connections of public transportation Perfect for who arrive by city airport 
 The bacon at breakfast was malodorous and put me off the whole meal It smelled like the meat was off I told the chef and he said no one else had complained The other improvements they could make is make the external feel safer At theories if arriving around 10 youths were gathered nearbknebif the doors smoking cannabis and making a huge noise  Good location The pizzeria provides an inexpensive option for dining and food is always good 
 Staff in check in not helpful and even rude Persisting that could not see the signature at the back of the debit card cos the ink had slightly fainted and was adamand to see alternative cards for payment Really unpleasant  comfortable room with nice view in a very good location 
 See above We was very disappointed with cleanliness of Hotel and room We booked online asking for lower floor accepting the fact we would have no window When we arrived No lower floor was mentioned When we asked we was just told the hotel would upgrade and would be on floor 8 we had no choice but to accept The quality of breakfast was awful Small kids plates Yes we could keep going to refill But honestly childish silly plates is not the way to go the food it self was disappointing we was shown to curtiacy at breakfast time just told there you go Sit wherever Cold coffee stains within the milk container in our table which we had to ask twice to be replaced No atmosphere Very disappointing Spoilt our stay an anniversary we won t forget for all the wrong reasons Also the room had 3 towels for two people of which one was dirty and only a hand towel And two sashets of coffee Lucky we didn t want a fresh coffee early before breakfast Come on liven up the place It used to be such a lovely place to stay
 The fact that wifi is not complementary Also I asked if I could check out 1 hour later and they asked for extra 10 GBP Short sighted when they see me in their hotel every other week The price compared well with other hotels in the area
 Very run down old furniture and disgusting old stainy carpets everywhere Terrible unstable wifi plus no free wifi even in the executive room  Good location for CW close to the tube and DLR too
 Noisy broken air conditioning sounded like a diesel generator noisy other guests throughout night poor sound insulation worst nights sleep for yearsNo Positive
 Wi Fi is free only in lobby in room first twenty minutes are free Medium soundproof walls The biggest challenge arose related to parking In spite of paying 21 pounds for overnight parking two times in bill it showed only 15 pounds guess problem with night shift employees who haven t given any receipts for parking So they wanted us to pay again and we refused So be aware when park your car at their area Hotel management promised to clarify the issue but not news from that time  Clean spacious room ideally located close to business centre of London as well as to historical sights Rooms cleaned every day as well towels and toiletries changed daily Tea pot coffee and tea bags in the room Diverse channels on TV and nice view over the city Iron table as well as ironing desk for trousers hair dryer 
 My goodness where to start On check in I was told that there were only smoking rooms available I don t smoke and that this was the only option as they were full given an upgrade but to another smoking room Took it as I had no option but I wish I hadn t The room stank it was actually stained yellow from the nicotine it was dirty disgusting it made me want to throw up the air conditioning actually made it worse The bathroom was the wore however all the tiles were dirty the silicone was falling off the ceiling had cobwebs and it was just vile No excuses given just told it s all we have Terrible Brittania you should be ashamed I wont be back  The location is great for Canary Wharf and the view isn t too shabby either 
 Cleaner kept knocking on the door constantly throughout the morning Balcony to be sectioned off More plug sockets in more accessible locations  Nice room stairs were different Comfy bed 
 Toooo laut in the room because of some working engines air conditionning or so The noise goes even through the windows and not covered by TV A pity as the rest is perfect No free wifi in the room  Very good buffet Large spaces in the lobby 
 Beds old and hard no pillow protectors dated broken furniture dark rooms no air con lifts slow long queues at check in prices vary too much with some nights over 250 and a general feel of under investment Location is great nice reception Italian restaurant is good and great views
 Breakfast bar remain open longer I got lost so came in the early hours and slept late When I went for breakfast it was closed at 10 a m also the restaurant Overall We had an excellent two nights  We were unexpected upgraded to a room which suited our need with no extra cost The staffs remember face especially in the bar Also the other staffs were efficient and prompt when a request was make 
 The ironing board was broken and the rooms are a bit tired  The rate was sensible and room was ok Hotel is in a good location for me and the bar area is good 
 Though a little outdated I find that charming as it is clean I have stayed there many times for business and it is ideal for City meetings and they always upgrade me and the beds are very comfortable and it is very clean
 No staff on enquiry desk Surely in the 21st century wifi should be free Know pool spa is separately managed but does not open until 8 needed to leave early should open at 7 Staff on reception were excellent Good link to central London on Jubilee Line and pleasant walk
 The buffet breakfast Coffee only on the table We could have been asked if we wanted coffee tea and a flask of water and teabags could have been on the table along with a little jug of milk  I booked a room without a window and was upgraded free of charge to a room with a window The staff I met one on reception and one greeting us at breakfast were pleasant and helpful
 Rooms a little outdated Pool shut too early not sure why there was an additional fee for the pool Room nice and big good view and decent value for money but needs TLC  Rooms a little outdated Pool shut too early not sure why there was an additional fee for the pool Room nice and big good view and decent value for money but needs TLC 
 Massive group of foreign students far too many for comfort who were also quite ignorant Large glass of chardonnay 11 ridiculous Breakfast good location couldn t be better Staff friendly 
No Negative Got an upgraded room at no extra cost Facilities were really good you can get pizza at the downstairs restaurant until late Would definitely stay again 
 No complaints  everything just right polite efficient staff very clean rooms swimming pool and gym facility so convenient In the same premises 
 For a 4 hotel there should be more than freeze dried instant coffee available to guests That s my only complaint  Excellent location On arrival I was upgraded at no extra cost Very comfortable room 
 Hotel room was very dirty Bathroom was old and shower didn t work properly The sofas were all torn due to excessive use Cupboards had broken handles and some of them were missing Coffee and tea had been splashed up the wall Bedding was dirty Broken air conditioning Soiled chairs Staff were rude and unable to communicate clearly Breakfast was rubbish there was a que of 40 people to get to the buffet and all the tables were dirty The location was good
 As above Very poor quality breakfast Mushrooms tasteless overcooked Grilled tomatoes inedible as was the bacon Both were of throwaway quality Coffee and fruit ok 
 I changed my room type from twin to double the day before I arrive and I received the conformation email But they didn t change it And the most unbelievable thing is when we asked their manager for help he just totally don t care about this problem and make no effort at all to help us or explain to us not even said sorry Actually he just shake his head said some random words and then walk away by himself  Location is fine 
 THE OPEN SITE JUST UNDERNEATH THE HOTEL CONSTANTLY PRODUCING A VERY IRRITATING DRILLING SOUND FROM VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING WEEKEND INCLUDED  BED EXTRA COMFY LOCATION PERFECT
 THE BREAKFAST ARRANGEMENT I have already complained about the awful queue which led to a cold meal To have all diners in one line was ridiculous I was ashamed as we had brought an American friend Also the bedroom furniture was shabby and the bedside light was torn room 724  The foyer spa size of room 
 The worst ever bed in the room Poor quality and not comfortable to sleep on it Very hard It is not worth for money Even travelodge and premier inn beds are of great qualities Please look into this seriously The bathroom is not tidy Close to my place of business
No Negative Upon arrival we had to wait in a queue for some time but understandably so as we came around 2pm We were then upgraded which was a plus really nice gesture We needed to print some tickets not a problem at all room has been done lovely it was more than I expected Place overall is a bit worn out but you work with what you ve got 
 The room didn t have hairdrier The rating of the hotel was kinda high and I have stayed to other hotels with the same rating The property is relative close to a metro station The service was good The room ok
 Alot of updates needed ie ripped wall paper marks on Wall and window screwed shut would have like to be able to open it but overall the room was clean comfortable stay Staff very friendly and helpful
 frankly speaking is unacceptable to pay 100 and have no free internet and no breakfast at all 12 each add on  Definitely a good hotel We loved the atmosphere The room was clean and nice Early check in 10am Is easy to reach west end by DLR or Jubilee 
 customer service very poor Uncomfortable bed dirty bathroom Neighbours next door was very loud and rude  the only thing good about the hotel was the view 
 Dated furnitures faded carpet and insufficient lighting Distant from centre and from underground station Breakfast is not included in price and very few choices in the neighbourhood No free wifi you can either purchase voucher or enjoy 20 minutes free wifi by signing up with your email address and allowing them to spam you with newsletters The hotel must have had its good old days but they are definitely long gone It is not comfortable or convenient for leisure and holiday nor will it provide professional service for people on business trip  The international hotel has very international staff team and it is possible to communicate in your native language if you encounter a staff member from your country However I wonder how well they can communicate in English when complicated issues come up 
 Breakfast could be better especially croissants  The whole atmosphere when you enter through main doors of hotel is amazing you feel like you are in palace I would stressed very good offers sometimes with huge discounts cleanliness and friendly and helpful staff 
 room was hardly 4 star peeling wallpaper hairdryer with the plug hanging off dirty carpet nice arse on the girl at reception great curry at the in house restaurant
 Finding one side of a double mattress that had failed at 11 00 pm clearly not brought to the attention of management who came to the room at 11 45pm offered to change the room Replacing the mattress would have been ok but apparently not available  The swift response to the issue we had with a sub standard springs failed on one side We were transferred to a larger room on the following day 
No Negative Great value for money Hotel was clean and staff super friendly Brilliant location Much better value than the more expensive newer hotels in the area 
 I ve got spinal problem s and the beds were like sleeping on the floor they were rock hard I couldn t sleep at all  Everything was very good food service ect 
 NO FREE WIFI Last time I had the breakfast it was disgusting bacon smelled bad scrambed eggs were milky I couldn t tell if the coffee was tea or coffee The only apple they had was a plastic appleNo Positive
 Well I have to say a little disappointed with a double bed such a stunning room I would have expected at least a king size bed I am 6 4 and I did like the fact my chest got a good wash in the shower had to kneel to wash my hair And I know this maybe picking but guys guys guys Such beautiful effort to the rom please please please Single ply toilet roll It was a bit of a letdown  I loved the staff for helping me get an upgrade to a higher floor The spiral staircase was a nice little touch the view and balcony were amazing The room size was excellent and perfectly decorated
 Hated leaving  Overall facilities of the hotel were perfect On site parking was a god send in London too Staff couldn t do enough for you And the view of the millenium dome from the room was brilliant 
 Breakfast seemed quite pricey so we didn t go for this as an option  We stayed here when going to see a band at o2 our stay was very comfy room was a good size and very clean 
 Breakfast was disappointing Very poor selection and presentation Bedroom was small but bed very comfortable First bedroom had no tempature control Room was so hot we could not stay in it for five minutes 
 I lived in this area when this hotel was built over 20 years ago now I think they need to invest some money on updating it especially as there is a brand new hotel being built opposite I got a great deal as I booked on the same day so it worked for us  The pool was nice But could use some improvements The location is great for going into the city or going to Greenwich The DLR is a short walk away 
 Attitude of the staff No communication skills  It s not very encouraging for lodgers to pay 10 every hour of checking out late No wifi in the rooms unless paid for No chance 
No Negative Just want to say thank you so much for upgrading our room We had a rare weekend without our little girl and we didn t have a massive budget Our room was incredible and we can t thank you enough for the upgrade We will be back 
 the all you can eat breakfast was nothing short of disgusting 13 50 3 bites of food and i walked out in total disgust excellent location for the o2 and the staff are brilliant
 Our room 846 faced east towards Canary wharf good view but trains very noisy and a ill fitting window didn t help Air con noisy  Great location for docklands and the 02 Hotel a bit dated but clean and comfortable
 Had to pay 4 per person to use the spa I ve stayed at other hotel and they do not charge their customers who stays there  We loved the view of the room we had
 It was very down at heel with jaded Victorian style decor unusual for such a modern building Although we booked with breakfast this had been lost in translation and I had to pay extra  The location was good with views over the wharf although all of the windows were dirty Staff friendly enough but not particularly helpful 
 Run down hotel old furnishings and fittings torn carpet throughout limited wifi in rooms no free access to facilities grubby outside only half lights on in foyer seating far too low in reception lounge area room temperature too hot throughout hotel unable to adjust in individual rooms old linen towels too small no safe in rooms for storage of valuables no fridge The list just goes on and on Close to underground Room size good 
 No free Wi Fi in the hotel rooms There were some suspicious looking stains on the wall and a hole in the ceiling patched up with duct tape The walls were quite thin and music could be heard all night  Location was quite central and the level of cleanliness was good The staff were helpful and friendly 
 The room was really hot We had asked them to fix the air con but nothing was done that we gave up They made a mistake on my booking and booked two rooms under my name I even called two days before just to make sure they only had one booking and they said that we did Then a day after we checked out we were charged 65 pound cancellation fee when we did show up Really not happy and won t refer anyone to this hotel I myself am in the hospitality industry and this treatment was really unacceptable No Positive
 Our room was tiny and cramped no window Bed was just next to the door so your total privacy was comprised Booked the hotel because we thought we were getting a bargain But we d rather had booked a holiday inn etc  View from the sitting area at night
 there is nothing I did not like we were given a room on the 13th floor as I suffer from fear of heights this was not good for me but when I went to reception this was changed for me straight away the bed was so cosy the food was lovely we had the gateau of the day which was peach the breakfast in the morning was nice we had a balcony and the view was nice
 Air con did not work when room was too hot they offered to open the window hot city fumes lovely alternative Tired look and feel to the hotel  But reasonable price for location 
 the women at the bar it was so rude I needed to serve my self and my wife and the way she was talking for the other staff it s wasn t good at all as a costumer I didn t liked  The bed was awesome and the environment too 
 Checked in and went in the room where it was 32 Degrees Celsius Air condition not working window sealed and can t be opened reception unable to help Didn t get almost any sleep and needless to say it was a horrible experience  Location is good as it s only few minutes walk from Canary Wharf
 Horrible Hotel The rooms are just above a major train line which operates every few minutes even during the night I couldn t sleep at all Breakfast was just embarrassing there were just some bread and sausages with no pastry fruits or yogurt Staff was not helpful or nice at all they didn t let me replace a room even though there were empty rooms  close to train station not such a good thing 
 The temperature control in the room didn t seem very responsive  The room was nice and big for the price Quite lavish decor which is beginning to slightly show its age Nice view and comfortable bedding Five minute stroll to all of the Canary Wharf high rises
 Being charged 6 for 20 minutes in the car park what an absolute rip off I will never stay at this hotel ever again When I raised this with reception they did absolutely nothing and just stared at me blankly The room thermostat was stuck at 30 degrees so when I rang reception to ask for a fan and for the locked windows to be opened I was told repeatedly that they were dealing with it but nothing happened At all I checked in just before 6pm and even by 8am the following morning the thermostat had only moved to 25 degrees Poor poor quality of service and lack of respect from staff Avoid No Positive
No Negative We were surprised by the room as at time of booking it said without window and we actually had a good view of the River Thames Not sure what they mean by no window as we were expecting a box room or cupboard for that price 
 There was no water in the toilet or for washing your face and I was told there was a problem with the water and they can not do anything about it and not even an apology I checked in about 2 15am and a rude waiter reluctantly showed where do i get a Sandwich from and when I went there I saw a mice is paying around in the dining area Dare I say more  Room was okay
 The hotel had no water running for almost 24 hours not even an apology from the staff Couldn t shower or even flush the toilet Staff kept telling us it should be on after an hour After 12 hours we called reception to complain and she laughed saying must be disgusting not being able to flush the toilet and offered us a voucher for a bottle of water Due to this we was not able to enjoy our stay and could not even use the pool as we would not be able to shower and the guccusi was not working either All in all I believe a discount money back should have been arranged as this was disgraceful Upon check out the receptionist just took our room keys and didn t even ask how out stay was If all facility s would have been working the hotel would be nice however this wasn t the case  Beds were comfortable and smoking room was accommodated as per request 
 The problem has happened both times we stayed at the property hot water goes of in the middle of the night so in the morning it s a freezing shower also water completely turns off throughout the day around 2 3 times for 3 4 hours which means no water to use for making tea washing your face a the odd shower someone wants in the day all these are not possible Please check that the pillow covers have definitely been changed when you inspect them carefully you can see the hair gel the wax and in my experience some blood which I found when I turned the pillow over asking the reception to changes these is a night mare as they have the classical hotel excuse of cleaners are only available in the mornings sir No fridge very dusty the cleaners literally clean it so quick that upon a glance it looks clean but when you spend 5 minutes you can see how dirty the place really is not recommendable at all  It has a nice location of course being in Canary Wharf 
 Beds not dressed well no valance which meant u could see a very old ugly bed Mattress ok thou Poorly maintained room Shower only dribbled not usable bath surface damaged spa facility on bath only blowing from one jet Not worth the money tbh Comfortable bar area easy to use parking good location
 The air conditioning and heating in the room didnt work and the room was like a sauna the whole time we were there even though we complained twice to reception and they said twice they would mend it and nothing happened Couldn t even just turn it off Cant open a window yourself and have to get them to open and close it but the location of the DLR made it impossible to leave it open at night  Good location and good budget hotel Lovely views from the bedrooms 
No Negative The beds were firm but comfy and the hotel was lovely and quiet 5 mins from Canary Wharf tube station Would definately stay here again Excellent value for money 
 Air conditioning did not work just made a noise and it was incredibly hot The outside windows were filthy and underground car park expensive Great location for the O2
 no fruit was available to take away at breakfast as I only have coffee it would have been nice to take away a piece of fruit for later in morning seeing as I paid for it the bathroom tiles were a little stained and the plug did not fit in bath so water would not stay in could not sleep as very noisy and we were on 10th floor so did not expect so much noise  the rooms were a very good size
 Asked to pay 30 for a hour early check in while the room was available Reception staff gm failed to explain why the charges will be applied Ended up seating in the car for a hour to check inNo Positive
 Parking in hotel car park cost us 42 from Friday to Sunday on top of a congestion charge of 14 Had never heard of congestion charges I was also charged to use health suite and gym Which I thought was part of price Location great staff great friendly Couldn t be more helpful
 I was given a tiny room with no window broken light and funny smell I mean is it even legal to have a bedroom with no window It was then swapped for a single room with a window but gosh this place needs some serious updating It s not cheap enough to justify the bad state of facilities and rooms  Location close to tube
 there was water works taking place which should of only took 2 hours to fix but when I woke up still was not working which was disappointing as I was unable to wash but understandably this was not the hotels fault and if there hadn t been water works and the water was working this would of been a perfect stay the room was lovely the staff was friendly bed comfy peaceful
 i didnt like that half the breakf st was cold not very verstile i didnt like tha the windows couldnt open i asked for smoking room with double bed didnt get it very comfortable stay but somethings could change  i liked the view n the way the hotel was set out i think the hotel overall is good the dinner was excellent slightly overpriced but exceelent
 Hotel in need of a major refurbishment and retrofit programme Breakfast was the typical mass produced and anaemic options  Eclectic d cor and furnishings Free upgrade to double room 
 The room temperature was 29 degrees on arrival We turned the aircon heating down and made our way out for the evening When we returned the temperature had gone to 31 5 degrees we again turned it down and hours later woke up as it had again gone up again clearly not working When asking staff how to turn it down due to serious uncomfortable heat in the room was told they didn t know how to Windows were bolted so we couldn t open them Clean hotel facilities obviously not great Wouldn t pay full price to stay again  They view from the window was very nice It was walking distance to Canary Wharf station and walking distance to nice restaurants Taxis to further out bars and restaurants wasn t to expensive either 
 Room 1114 Weird setup for Executive double room as soon as you enter thru the door you are faced with a Spiral staircase and have to go up a floor to get to the room The central heating was not working The hotel provided portable heaters  Nothing can beat the location if you are having your meeting in Canary Wharf 
 Prior to our arrival we upgraded to and executive suit on finding our room we were disappointed the beds were pushed together wallpaper and draw were hanging off stains on everything wall curtains wallpaper No heating We complained on the Friday night our complaint was apparently logged Spoke to the manager when we left who clearly just wanted to get rid of us dispite being told to write our complaint in an email our complaint has never been actioned To add insult to injury we then found our hotel room for sale at a reduced rate of nearly 150 Not a pleasent experience  The location
 The fact you had to pay to park your car and bit was quite expensive  The restaurant food was very nice and very reasonable The location was excellent 
 The hotel is in need of a full refurbishment But is always cheaper compared to other nearby hotels because of that  Location of the hotel is very good Only few minutes walk from Canary Wharf 
 Took about 45 minutes to check in when I arrived And I was the only one arriving at that time Surroundings were boring In case you want to go out in the evening you need a cab or the tube But only a few stops to Tower Bridge  Big room with dining table and separate bathroom with spa at a very fair price Great location only 5 minutes walk from Canary Wharf Underground Station on Jubilee Line Close to full 3G signal on 11th floor on my 3 subscription 
 The hotel is very very dated if it costs too much to change the carpet at least have them cleaned Also the additional charge for use of the health facilities is annoying  Location to Canary Wharf is good although main access path is due to be closed shortly 
 Hotel extremely old and worn online photos not current Toilet didn t flush basin didn t drain properly Dirty brown marks on the bedroom walls No Positive
 Room s were vile took 3 rooms to get us a semi decent one staff are rude 1 room was infested with moths and carpet was eaten by them Was more like a 1 2 star hotel not value for money  Nothing the hotel was vile 
 Windows were filthy dirty but didn t spoil the view or my stay Nothing to complain to the staff about The weather  Convenience of the location 
 10 early room 4 use of pool 5 use of safe Spa Pool could use a renovation All rooms had carpets no wooden hygenic floors  Price was reasonable
 Only 20 min free Internet daily in your room then need to buy vouchers Note free WiFi is nowadays available even in the streets No computers for guests either No tea biscuits to accompany free tea in the room  Location views lounge chandeliers Also very kind to let me stay an extra hour for free 
 The room we were given had certainly seen better days Carpet was worn and badly fitted kettle did not work independently but better than the air conditioning that did not work at all  The view was great 
 Parts of hotel for example the gym even though these facilities are there they look like they been left there from 20years ago Good location for marathon and nice rooms gym and fitness facilities are very old and dated with new equipment and touch up would make hotel very good 
No Negative When booking i asked for a smoking room but wasn t put in one a quick word with one of the very helpful staff changed our room immediately without a fuss a lovely view from the 12th floor would definitely stay again clean room and helpful friendly staff
 The room was tired Carpets were threadbear wallpaper peeling bathroom tiles were cracked where previous fittings had been skirting all scuffed Stair carpet worn Not very good communication at breakfast Limited choice The location to the o2 Near to tube 
 No double rooms available Eventually allocated one Room lock did not work so could not get in and out Toilet had not been cleaned properly No compensation offered Generally felt like a place that did the facade well but under service staff and facilities very basic No Positive
 The service was really poor It was London Marathon weekend and the hotel was completely unprepared for the volume of people Had to wait hours to get seated at the restaurant then another hour for our food which was ice cold The whole building is in need of a revamp Very expensive weekend for a terrible experience I have stayed in many hotels in my life and never gave a bad review ever before The fact that I am now just underlines how terrible the experience really was from everyone I would never recommend this hotel to anyone in fact I have already warned so many to never stay there A shame really as it is in a perfect location It does need a completely new management system really as we could see that the culture of the hotel is one where they do not care well not on the weekend we were there  The location is great 
 The room was a bit shabby and could do with upgrading The room was also cold The breakfast was basic and fairly tasteless  We were upgraded to an executive room from a standard room 
 tried to order room service but told that it wasn t a able yet saw evidence of trays being delivered to other rooms The breakfast was very basic although the room was amazing and most of the staff were very helpful all in all would recommend to family and friends  Room was amazing along with the pizza and steak 
 Strange decor It is made to look like an old classical hotel maybe 19th century with tassels and chintz etc but it is clearly a modern building in canary wharf Now that the decor is all getting a bit worn at the edges it just looks tired and old fashioned Most of the sockets in the room were old style round pin sockets so we had to share the only available normal socket for all of our chargers  We stayed for the London marathon The beds were comfortable the water pressure in the shower was excellent and the water was hot 
 Freezing cold water in rooms women staff couldn t even crack a smile Waitress even told us in bar food isn t great Jacuzzi wasn t hot enough Steam room was nice Would of been better off in ibis No window either and dirty plates and bottles in corridors steam room was hot enough and location was good for London marathon
 Breakfast menu was okay a bit busy due to the London Marathon Our room was spacious with a great view comfortable bed If I d known I would have brought my swimming trunks re swimming pool spa facilities
 Long check in despite the marathon real drawn out old fashioned check in The Room Cleaner she simply pushed everything to a side on the table and threw out a couple of items she would have known were not rubbish had she looked If there are things on the desk leave it alone Very very rude and unprofessional Gym closes 7pm and an hour before is last entry Double bed was the smallest double I ve ever slept in 7 per day for wifi in the rooms Rip off Breakfast room was freezing  Location is next to the Hilton very close to Canary Wharf Great feel to the hotel warm and cosy reception area Parking on site was great 
 The kettle didn t work and the shower leaked  Comfortable and great location The decor is good a mix of grand and homely The staff were very friendly I would stay there again 
 The mattress was thin and could feel the panel bases  Fantastic location if you re attending the O2 the staff were lovely We got a free room upgrade The decor is a little dated but that was expected great value for money The room next door were very loud we called reception and attended to the matter straight away 
 Breakfast not up to standard of rest of hotel disappointing  Large rooms comfortable beds location excellent bar staff excellent and reasonable pricing of drinks easy walking access from Heron Quays and Canary Wharf stations so ideal for 02 
 We were upgraded to an executive room where the air con heating didn t work An electric heater was provided that we dare not keep on at night Asking for a thicker duvet was like asking for he earth Breakfast paid extra in the morning was a sad affair 13 50 and nothing to eat And staff comment was it s not my job see the chef Very helpful After a word with the restaurant manager all was sorted but half hour lost Won t be going back here again  Location excellent
 The fact I was told I d get my vat receipt via email 2 days later still nothing rang them on a 087 number 1 min was told I d get it next day 5 days later still nothing Breakfast
 more staff needed on reception room decor was tired but still good value for money  comfy bed good bar prices for london location minutes from dlr and tube
 The bathroom door not closing the noisy environment There was no comfort The bathroom door would not close you can hear the train after night and 5 20 am If this was not bad enough we had to listen to drilling all day We went to celebrate our anniversary at a hotel we first me we book this every year and this time the experience was awful 
 Checked in they gave me the key Once I went to the room I went to bathroom two minutes later there was a knock on my door three staff members saying I need to leave when I asked why they said we don t need a reason to ask anyone to leave I did nothing wrong I was in my room for 5 minutes maximum it seemed they were treating me like I did something wrong or discriminating This overall interpreted my event for the day as I had to change hotel last minute and now thinking of doing an official complaint towards the staff as it was out of order  From what I did see the room was spacious and had a nice view but very old fashioned
 Room was vile first room given didn t even have a window change rooms to a room that s carpet looked like it have been eaten by bugs Staff slow hotel out of date and not value for money Location
 Additional hidden cost Extra pay for wifi Poor mobile phone reception so no personal wifi either Extra pay for gym or pool Dated decor Unhelpful staff Rude reception manager Nothing
 The temperature control in the room was awful The air conditioning did nothing but make the room warmer and at one point it reached 30 we were absolutely sweltering Not comfortable at all Lovely helpful staff perfect room size and room facilities for the two of us Really couldn t complain with our actual stay
 The receptionist was not very welcoming when we checked in and it took them a long time possibly because of the room change The bed was a bit hard but that is more down to personal preference The view wasn t very pretty The towels provided were rather small and it was tricky to get the shower to a comfortable temperature  The room was beautiful and the bathroom was clean My booking was upgraded to a better room for no extra charge Lovely upmarket location Many say that the decor is outdated but I found it charming 
 Checking in was very slow and the staff member at checking may have been tired I got there late but was not very welcoming I ve stayed before standards are high good value for money
 AC wasn t working When I complaint about it someone came in to fix I was hoping that he will fix the AC But to my surprise he let the window open and let the natural cold air come in to cool the room So not sure if the room given to me was AC or GO Natural room Worst experience It was closer to my Canary Wharf office
 Lifts were appalling massive queue and I ended up squashed in a loft with 9 men and I m a women that was bit awks Mattress was really uncomfortable and room was way to hot parking to expensive aswell The reception area looked lovely
 Asked for kettle replacement as swiich wasn t working either it wasn t replaced or the replacement kettle was also broken either way it was disappointingNo Positive
 Pizzas in the pizzeria rubbery stodgy House wine acidic tasting Requested a quiet room but ended up next to the very noisy Docklands Light Railway so had to request a move  Handy location if working visiting Docklands Comfortable room with a bath 
 The rooms are dated tired d cor really would benefit from a refit Especially considering the cost of the executive rooms Slow service in the restaurant  Clean and comfortable with large well appointed rooms The views across London are excellent 
 The state of the hotel in general was very poor The windows in the bar were rusty and needed replacing The room was a total state and not updated for decades no doubt The bathroom was disgusting and I could not call down in the morning to order breakfast to my room as the room phone was dead and I did not have time to go and eat due to needing to be out early for a conference I will never stay there again  The bar staff were nice and friendly
 No wifi Unpleasant staff Old management style need a form to go to breakfast Not possible to go through the backdoor to walk to the metro despite the fact that it would shorten the way My card couldnt open the bedroom door twice this put me in much delay one the last day and I missed my train I wouldnt recommand this hotel No Positive
 The room was certainly one of the older un renovated rooms located which meant were woken up at 8am to the sound of building work in the room next door Yes unbelievable but they put us in a room where the wall was being stripped in the room next door to our room that woke us both up at 8am The room itself was very dirty and on arriving back from a night out at 2am and getting into bed it was clear that my sheets had not been washed since the last person stayed there They smelt of dried sweat and the bed was covered with hairs Unfortunately in the morning i was unable to have a shower because the shower was broken with either extremely hot water or ice cold I complained in the morning to Pascal Languila Duty manager and i was told there was nothing that could be done and i had to write to the head office The entire experience ruined our entire break I have travelled all over the world and start in hotels and hostels in many parts of Asia and have never complained about a hotel before but this is by far the worst I ve ever stayed in I have complained to the head office and have not had any response  location to get and from O2 for a concert
 It feels in need of considerable love and attention a rather dark and gloomy place with strange statuary and heavy furniture  Its location near to London City Airport and in the midst of Canary Wharf and Docklands with easy accessibility on public transport Comfortable bed 
 the hotel really needs refurbishment the carpets are old have carpet mosquitoes air conditioning is not working properly water pipes are blocked and water is not flowing properly the size of rooms are quite large comparing to other hotels with similar price range They have rooms for smokers I could not open a window out of everything the staff do not care about anything I think this hotel is not 4 star
 Poor area very tired n old Just think poor area could be cleaner and the stair up need a good scrub with bleach No spa which again was disappointing 
 Value for money it definitely wasn t wasn t told swimming and internet was extra staff were not welcoming with exception of the bar man  Furniture is poor and needs updating very dated decor accessories is bathroom broken ie hanging off wall soap dish stains on floor etc
 The girl behind the bar was so miserable I would say she verged on being rude obviously didn t want to be working on a Friday night Breakfast at a cost of 10 00 per person I couldn t eat it the bacon tasted of pure grease the sausages were rock solid and the scrambled eggs could have passed for porridge I asked for a poached egg and was told it would take 10 to 15 minutes as its not on the menu Coffee already on the tables in a flask you couldn t drink this if you were desperate When I arrived I was told I had to sit on the left of the dining room would be nice to choose where you sit like an adult The staff in the breakfast room were also very ignorant everything was simply too much trouble Reminded me of eating at Butlins many years ago I stay in hotels a lot and in particular London but haven t stayed at Canary Warf before I assumed it would be a little upmarket and couldn t believe the price The foyer is beautiful the room was bit although a little run down which is fine but the staff really do spoil this hotel  When I checked in I was given a complimentary upgrade by a very helpful young man the young girl on reception when I checked out was also very friendly 
 AC didn t work Uncomfortably hot Hotel room was looking a little tired breakfast was so so  Price was good for the location Had all the little bits you d expect any good hotel to have 
 The room was too warm for us and impossible to cool down averaged around 23 25 degrees Very close to Canary Wharf one stop from the O2 quiet area polite staff large and comfortable rooms 
 The shower was very difficult to get to the right temperature the signal on the television kept going off and on the windows in the room did not open the room leaflet advised swimming facilities closed at 9pm to be told it closed at 6pm the all you can eat buffet is open based on demand and was not open when we were there the temperature and fan facility was not working in the room the bed was very hard however this may appeal to some  The view is fantastic and smoking room was available 
 not sure if room had been cleaned to 100 as found something under my bed and left on the bedside table not even sure what it was Couldn t open a window don t do chips for breakfast but that s everyone s choice I suppose  room temperature good 
 The rooms was very small the carpets had really seen better days and the worse thing was the noise coming from the conditioners outside my window It woke me up every couple of hours Do take ear plugs with you The hotel generally is a little worn down it probably used be a good 4 star about 20 years ago but is now no more than 3 star I should think It s fine for a short business stay but not the most romantic or comfortable place for a longer stay  It was good value for London 90 single room one night stay and the bed and bathroom were clean It had all basic comforts such as kettle iron e ironing board hairdryer 
 The A C was not working so very hot in the room WE asked for the window to be open there was no way to shut ourselves  Good access to the places we wanted to see explore The food places were good although a little expensive
 the room had previously been occupied by a heavy smoker and with no facility to open the windows the bedding stank heavily of smoke the air con had to be on all night to remove the build up of smoke from the bed totally unacceptable location was fine
 Even the basic ammenaties were not available that you would be used to in regular hotel rooms this was more like a shoe string budget hotel at a expensive London price Ideally they should be charging 40 per night No Positive
 The service was bad the AC of the room was not working 31 C in the room due to the nice weather and they told me that the AC in the whole building was not working and could not put me in another room with working AC They lied to me as my collegue was in a room with working AC The personnell is lying and that is not acceptable  location in Canary wharf
 Windows dirty due to building works nearby The shower was temperamental running cold one minute and very hot the next Room d cor a bit tired  Handiness to public transport Lots of shops nearby also restaurants Museum of Docklands a short walk away also a very upmarket Wetherspoons Hotel has 3 restaurants to choose from Nice size bedrooms 
 The worst stay in London The staff are incompetent The facilities are dirty I took a lot of pictures of blood on the side of the bath tub health and safety issues with cords hanging out of the tv Definitely not worth the stayNo Positive
 The air conditioning didn t seem to work properly and because you can t open the window our room reached 26d at times  Really nice hotel with lovely clean rooms and helpful staff 
 the television was too far away and badly positioned and there was only enough milk for 1 cup of tea coffee each and only enough toiletries for 1 person slightly disappointing just a very minor compalint The staff were welcoming helpful friendly and accommodating the view was great The room was a decent size and pretty clean We had a comfortable and enjoyable stay
 Room was far too hot staff did try to improve the situation but apparently the windows can only be opened by staff  location close to rail links Also staff were excellent 
 When booked I was told the swimming pool was included Yet when I went to use it I was told that I would have to pay 4 a day if I wanted to swim So I ve paid all this money for a 4 hotel and then had to pay more to use the pool  Staff were lovely and the rooms were clean spacious and comfortable 
 Decor looking a bit tired but its a huge hotel and all things were minor Very hard to find negatives without nit picking  Comfy bed cozy room plenty of hot water for a nice deep bath All staff very friendly and helpful Great value for money 
 Aircondition is broken and i get no wake up call in morning although I called reception twice asked for it Restaurant food in plastic box while i collect it  Furniture is stylish 
 When we first arrived the room was baking hot We tried to turn on the Air Con but it only seemed to make the room even hotter Eventually I had to go down to reception and ask a concierge to open the window for me as they are locked and cannot be opened by hotel guests During the night I hardly got a wink of sleep With the window open the room was still far too hot and was now coupled with the sound of DLR trains roaring past the window from the wee hours of the morning It wasn t just the sound but the reverberations from the train line seemed to make the whole building shake Very hostile environment to try and sleep in On handing our keys into reception we were not asked if we had enjoyed our stay or if there had been any problems I guess they rely exclusively on online surveys now  The staff were very friendly and helpful When my partner and I got back from a gig after midnight the kitchen staff were willing and able to cook us a pizza Thanks guys Room was spacious clean and just what we were expecting from the description online Hotel is 3 minutes walk from the Canary Wharf DLR line right in the heart of the commercial district 
 I went to Pizza Resturant they have on one day Saw at least 4 mices around me I went to the Spice India Resturant the following day and one of the guys wasnt very good I asked for a big water and when it came in a glass bottle I changed my mind to have a small one he didnt look happy at all although it was a minimal change in my order I wasnt happy with these 2 incidents Nice Room Nice Location Nice facilities
 Bed uncomfortable too hard and seen better days Heating in room controls not working Room too hot and A C noisy and didn t seem to have any affect Breakfast cold and congealed as left on hot plate for a long time Staff in breakfast hall clearing your plate away literally the second you put your knife and fork down and not even asking if you have finished and very surly looking as though the guests were an inconvenience Wifi not free to guests staying  Location
 No subtitles on the television as we are both Deaf Spiderweb on the window I don t mind but need it clean for the next clients  Lovely view Bed comfy Lovely shower 
 Didn t really get time to see much of the hotel It was clean and tidy but maybe in the future could do with being modernised Good value I thought though  I like the location and felt it was good they had the pizza restaurant 
 pretty much everything was old and worn off The spring mattresses where can you still find those are not comfy at all Air con always switched back to 28 degrees Celsius who needs it that hot windows allow noise to come through gym was really shabby and with admission fee no free internet in rooms  not much I am travelling lots for business But I have seldom seen a hotel that was more worn off 
 The TV didn t work initially and the phone was not working An engineer came and I was awaiting for someone else to come and sort the phone Nobody came so I rang reception again was told to go back to reception and I would be allocated another room The toilet in the room had also been used and the bathroom wasn t very clean generally I was also told at reception that I would be allocatedx a river view this wasn nt the case I changed rooms the 2nd room was improved but very tired and the bed was most uncomfy overall very disappointed and the staff weren t that helpful or friendly  I had a nice wine in the bar the location is good for Cnary Wharf 
 endless list bed was rock hard sleeping on floor would have been better room temp was far to high constant heating on as it must have been broken told staff and nothing done about it old and outdated the view
 Cleaners do not change beddings unless you ask The carpets are old and there are carpet mosquitos flying over the room  The rooms are nice and have some space to move
 7 for 24 hours of WiFi which didn t even work in the morning The bath was almost entirely clogged the shower was either freezing cold or an equivalent to an erupting volcano Not worth the 4 stars but it is acceptable for the price No Positive
 Not a great deal not to like view wasn t great but no big deal Few bits of wear and tear in the room but again not a big deal room was still very clean and comfortable There weren t many plug facilities so we found ourselves having to unplug the television often to charge phones and use electrical items  Staff were very friendly and very helpful The room was big and comfortable with black out curtains There was a beautiful Indian restaurant situated on the ground floor stunning food The hotel was in a great place about a 5 10 minute walk to the metro stations which got us in to central London within 10 minutes Ordered room service which was reasonably priced and served very quickly All in all a great stay 
 The weather wasnt great Good safe location easy enough to get around in London by trains Hotel was great could tell it was a 5 star 10 or so years ago Classic feel with great facilities and staff were great Having the gym and pool etc was awesome The rooms were also very clean and nice bed and bathroom 
 d cor was old fashioned and the bathroom badly needed decorating and a good clean bed was comfortable and the room was well equipped well situated close to the DLR
 Cheap toiletries and very thin cheap toilet paper in the en suite bathroom gave a poor impression  Room was nicely furnished with a view of Canary Wharf Location was excellent very easy and quick to get to the hotel from Canary Wharf Staff were helpful Room was a little run down but for the price I paid it was excellent value for money 
No Negative Great location less than 10 minutes from Canary Wharf tube station I paid for a double room without a window and was upgraded to a much bigger room The whole place was comfortable excellent value for money 
 The decor is dated the bed small The hotel is in need of maintenance They will charge you for everything extra There wasn t a fridge in the room and yet they would charge us 5 everytime they would come upstairs to deliver anything even water The showers didn t work properly getting cold and hot to the point of burning my skin The swimming pool is an extra 4 per person and it s absolutely filthy And the Easter decoration was ridiculous picture attached  nothing
 the staff was rude and i had blood staines on my bed sheet and reported it to reception they did not attend until after 1 hour also there was a strong smell of drugs in the 12th floor as they gave me a smoking room i am very upset and unhappy i made them aware of this and was totally ignored  there was nothing postive about my overall experince with Brittania 
 The carpets in the hallways are all worn and plug sockets in the hotel room were really loose and falling out of the wall Breakfast was really expensive  Location is perfect 
 The staff are 100 eastern european which have lack of customer service The word please is not exist and mostly they are rude Air condition is not working everywhere and they will unlock the window which is doesnt sound right The internet is not working most of the time plus you have to pay for it and once you call the reception to solve the internet issue they tell you to call the internet provider  Nothing
 getting tiered room was 38C when arrived got down to 26C before we left far to hot for a late winter night No aircon or opening windows just built in fan systemNo Positive
 Staff were not friendly Swimming pool was due to open at later time of 10am later due to it being a holiday weekend However Sunday they didn t open until 10 15 Check out 11 and a charge for any later than 11 I left a necklace and when I phoned was told they needed my bank card details to return it and they didn t know what accounts would debit for the service Felt it to be a very commercial arrangement with customer service of less importance than commerce  The location is great for Docklands near DLR and Canary Wharf underground Nice decor swimming pool available at extra cost but a good swim Rooms comfortable and clean 
 Poor staff attitude Car park should not be used by woman traveling alone Poor check in process Srea undergoing marjor building works To the front and rear of the building Cold room service food I found a long hair in the bath not mine  The only good thing about my stay was the location and cost of the room Other than that it was poor poor poor Spent the extra 10 20 and stay somewhere else 
 The fact that you have to pay for everything there Wifi Gym etc and the fact that the carpets had holes in them and let s not forget they are located at least 5 min walking from the nearest station  I liked the fact that it is good value for money fairly clean and quiet 
 Would love a safe  One night for 70 in this location at a hotel of this standard was fantastic value and would be good at twice the price Extremely convenient for Canary Wharf Room was very spacious especially for London good quality bedding comfortable bed quiet 5th floor room 537 no view just the building opposite Powerful shower Trouser press iron and ironing board 
 I can t think of any complaints  The rather lavish surroundings and pleasant service of the staff The comfort and window view of the room 
 Beds are a bit narrow furniture and soft furnishing are all very tired The lifts to the rooms must be the slowest I ve ever experienced  I was upgraded from single standard to twin Plenty of space niice clean bed Good choice at breakfast buffet Good locaiton for me as I work in Canary Wharf
 very tired furnishings not the cleanest bathroom and aircon not working with no ability to open the window temp shown as 27 5 and no way of cooling it down Staff need to learn to smile  Good value given location but could do better 
 Staff was not friendly especially for check in out Room was noisy close to Overground Unconfortable bed Poor quality breakfast Close to Canary Wharf Business Area
 I was put in a smoking room as i requested and ofcourse a smokig room may sometimes slightly smell of smoke but this room was filthy it stunk and it was just a massive dissapointment from a normally amazing hotel I also had to wait at the back door for somebody to open it for 25 minutes as the front entrance was shut this wasnt late at night it was around 7 pm  I will be honest i normally love this hotel bur agter this experience i wont be staying here again
 The room was very cold and we were not given additional bedding when requested by recepton The staff were quite abrupt The breakfast was poor The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night The room was spacious and clean
 The hotel was outdated double bed was two singles bed pushed together very uncomfortable Room not too clean dust and flies Not much selection on room service menu  Food was nice but not much choice
 This hotel need to be refractors It s not a 4 stars hotel any more and the people there are so cheap you wouldn t believe it They ask you to pay the nights before you get the key They give you an invoice without printing the price you have to pay and tell you it is to keep this secret between customers For WIFI you have to pay 7 pounds on top of the price of the room by day to get it Otherwise you get free Wifi at reception The guy that invented this is a genius On the evening the reception is full of people that don t want to pay the 7 pounds Some order drinks and it is good business for the hotel About the room the carpet has holes and is not stick anymore on the floor The paper on the walls is full of holes and never been changed The furnitures have been hit so much by baggages that would need to be repainted It is confortable and calm but how can it be rated 4 stars  very calm
 very cold room very slow staff no mini bar poor restaurant for such location the entire room shakes when the train passes by i will never return there again  BUSINESS LOCATION but there is also four season hotel for that
 Check in took too long too bureaucratic To pay the parking fee also took too long about 15 minutes The hotel had my details when I booked just need to get me to sign and give me my room key Their system for booking people in must be very complicated judging by the staff tapping away on the computer keys  Location within easy reach of the O2 Arena where we went to see a show 
No Negative Hotel is a reasonable location near to Canary Wharf and at the rate I got on booking com was great value Room was standard clean and tidy and had what I needed for an overnight stay on business 
 The entrance feels like a goods in area at a supermarket and not very pedestrian friendly I often had to walk around coaches delivery vehicles and rubbish trucks to get to where I was going I d expect a doorman to greet me at the door and help me I wouldn t expect this at a discount hotel but it would seem appropriate for a hotel like this Only 3 lifts serving 12 floors meant there was significant waiting times during peak hours Made worse by the staff using them to transport cleaning karts further restricting capacity Slight smell of damp in the bathroom didn t leave a welcoming feel when walking into the room There was no minibar in the room I don t normally use the minibar but as I arrived late on a Sunday night all the shops and eateries were closed The surrounding area is undergoing a lot of building work which at times could be a little noisy  Close to Canary Wharf business district Average hotel did everything I expected of a hotel There were facilities such as a health club and a restaurant available but I didn t use these 
 My heating wasn t working and I didn t get a double bed I was not happy The cards to open the door didn t work properly  The hotel was very nice and clean room was spacious and comfortable staff were helpful Would stay again as it was good value for a 4 star hotel and a great location 
 I expect to get more than 20 mins of free wi fi I don t expect to pay extra for the gym when it is advertised as being one of the facilities on offer at the gym Location is excellent Rooms are clean
 Staff seemed indifferent Had to make my self known to be acknowledged The lady at check out didn t ask me how my stay was she just didn t care when I returned the room key Loud aircon noise but no cooling The room actually the hotel is in need to renovation  Nice comfy bed great location for work tea facility in the room public transport walking distance 
 On arrival there was no eye contact never mind and communication No smile to be seen anywhere Food was standard Very expensive for a shabby ignorant hotel  The toast was ok 
 Very old bed furniture tiny single beds bedding very small am not sure they are for single beds Cleaning staff not friendly at all On arrival nobody takes you to the room I was in room 429 which I expected to be between rooms 428 and 430 which is not the case I asked one of the cleaners where Room 429 is located and she did not assist at all She continued doing her routen I found that very unacceptable  The location is excellent if one is attending meetings within Canary Wharf 
 Tatty tired and outdated decor furniture that needs a serious refresh Other than when checking in we did not receive a single smile or piece of friendly service from any of the primarily Eastern European staff members The breakfast was appalling so don t waste even more money on that We won t be staying there again  The only bit of good service I received was the friendly girl that checked me in and gave me a window room at no extra cost as I didn t realise I had booked one with no window The only other plus points was the location and how clean the room was Kudos to the cleaners 
 the whole place was very run down and in need of a serious make over The room was dated and had black marks on the walls the windows were very dirty the shower was nothing more than a hot drip unless you added cold water then noise from the DLR staff not particularly bothered There was a mix up with our booking and they could no decide who was at fault them or booking com so upgraded us to an executive I would hate to see what our original room looked like They even tried to give us another room which belonged to another guest because it had a combination of my friend and I s names  the location was good and the front entrance looks good 
 From outside the hotel promised so much sadly it did not deliver Miserable staff poor maintenance and rooms that had tried to be something up market but just didn t work Bathroom fan not working toilet roll cheap left on side empty cup holders in bathroom TV miles away from the bed Would prefer a Premier Inn for value and comfort any day No Positive
 The bed was so small for a couple the bathroom was dirty behind taps in bathroom it was all rusty the bottom of pan in bathroom was dirty the windows in bedroom manky the breakfast in the morning was cold dont know how long it had been lying would not stay there again  Not a lot
 It s a rather tired hotel and the parking is 21 per day which is huge Worse still is that you only get 20 minutes free wifi after which there is a charge of 7 per day The swimming pool isn t free for guests yes you guessed it there s a charge The bed wasn t great springs felt through old mattress and decor was abysmal Really naff 80s Miserly number of tea bags and the box of tissues has just a couple left in it The whole experience is like Ryanair You get the absolute minimum and customer service is not what this place is about Will definitely not be returning as a Premier Inn would have been better  proximity to Canary Wharf
 Unhelpful and sullen staff on the desk and breakfast room one being an X prisoner I remember from the establishment I work in concierge was very good  Hotel position location of the tube overall look
 The room was not as clean as we would ve liked stains on carpet and chair upholstery There was no possibility of fresh air to the room ie no opening windows and it was consistently too hot so that we had to have the air conditioning on 24 hours but this was ineffective The self service breakfast was plentiful but average eg flasks of hot water provided for making tea a pot made with boiling water would be preferable heavily diluted orange juice and stale croissants  Loved the location good for the O2 one stop away on the Jubilee line and central for travelling generally Staff were friendly 
 Noise from AC fans and building site Novotel was annoying and spoilt my sleep only lucky I had Airplane earplugs with me Decor atmos elevators in house Pizzeria luxurious room for reasonable price paid in that location handy for South Quay DLR good class clientelle no riff raff 
 Nothing I don t like maybe the windows not being able to open in some double rooms Everything the staff are ever so lovely it feels very welcoming here
 Room was 32 degrees when we got there Set the air con to 16 but hardly worked and didn t reduce the temperature Phoned and explained They said they would send someone up We were going out and expected something to be done and or communicated to us When we got back late that night room temperature was still a very hot and uncomfortable 27 degrees Not good at all No Positive
 Indian restaurant was closed for our entire stay and the walk to and from the Underground was a pain  Stunning hotel lovely staff Would definitely go back 
 Room needs total refurbishment peeling wallpaper stained tiles worn woodwork filthy Windows a toilet that wouldn t flush efficiently  Location Foyer Public areas 
 Being picky here but the skirting boards could have done with a lick of paint that would have added to the perfect room  Spacious clean room Comfortable bed and crisp sheets Great view of CW 
 There was no room service despite being part of the offering so I had no dinner Breakfast was advertised as 6 00am onwards but didn t start until 7 00am Both of these things impacted my stay No Positive
 Can be noisy if facing onto the DLR tracks  Nearest affordable property to Canary Wharf Ideal for those travelling on business and not expecting a luxurious holiday 
 What I didn t like was everything from the staff who where very rude and not at all helpful to the restaurant the rooms very bad experience couldn t wait to get home definitely not worth the money  Liked absolutely nothing about this hotel 
 the d cor and bedroom furniture was very tired looking could do with a revamp breakfast was plentiful however was over priced for the lack of quality the location of hotel for means of my trip was very good staff friendly
 The room smelt of cigarette smoke Uncomfortable mattress on the bed you could feel the springs I d booked a room without a window so as to be in a quieter location but turned out to be a room with a window overlooking the DLR so very noisy Very frustrating that most of the sockets in the room were round pin ones so there was only one usable plug for charging phones etc Staff on leaving didn t even bother to ask whether everything had been OK with the stay Not great value for money overall for the same price you d have got a comfier and probably quieter bed at a Travelodge or similar  Location to Canary Wharf was good 5 10 minutes walk
 The air conditioning to cold for this time of year Couldn t get the room warm and the breakfast room was also to cold in the morning Like the location One tube stop from the o2 and 3 minutes walk from tube station
 very dated and in desperate need of a refurb staff were not very friendly and half of them didn t understand me beds were comfy and noise was minimal
 Decor in hotel was a bit dated lifts were shaking lots and appeared old water pressure in shower was very bad Room booking said windowless room arrived to a room with a window and a view towards Canary Wharf a nice surprise
 Almost everything When arrived at reception 2 working women non of them event told me hello welcome one minute please ignore me for a few minutes until one of them was ready to take care of me Nice Gym room but not included and even not possible to charge the room Nice Spa but not included and even not possible to charge the room Free Wifi but only 20 minutes Breakfast not inclued I saw it and it was very poor did even not want to have it in extra Also need to be refreshed Too hot room with only vent or heating Run away  Location was close to my working area
 Everything Its a monstrosity The whole process was usless From booking com to the actual hotel both are usless and incompetent I got qouted one price then put it up by 20 Phone both hotel and booking com to just get told nothing we can do Will not be using again
 when booking i asked for a quiet room i was put in a room with the kitchen ducting makingg a noise they cvhanged the room and as well there was extraction noises outside i then gave up also needed an international line due to my iphone not working was told not possibile  close to exhibition
 I was a bit surprised when I tried to use the gym and was told I have to pay this was never mentioned during the booking actually this is one of the reason I booked this hotel because it had a gym Also the room I stayed in was outdated so old and shabby tried to open the door of a wardrobe it broke and the tap had missing part  the price is reasonable for a good location so close to Canary Wharf metro station
 i booked this hotel for 3 things WiFi as i am in london on business a gym so i can have a work out to start my day and location Wifi was only 20 minutes a day for free just enough time to download emails gym cost was extra i was sure when i booked it mentioned that there was a gym and no where mentioned the extra charge hotel is old and needs an upgrade bed was very old i felt the springs coming through the matress Shower was also old and very average  Location was quite good
 I first stayed in this hotel about 12 years ago I don t think the interior has seen a paintbrush or carpet fitter since It s very very tired and desperately needs bringing up to date  The location is perfect for Canary Wharf
 Unfortunately my partner was kept awake all night due the dlr this is something that can t be helped I understand but we had no warning of this upon arrival The lady on reception was foreign which is fine but my partner had to repeat the simple name of Scott several times and had to remind her several times that we were paying by cash the process in general took a really long time with her  The view from the room was amazing The bar area was comfortable and lively enough 
 Our bed was a bit uncomfortable but maybe the mattress just wasn t to our preference  We have stayed here before so knew what to expect Our room was nice and clean An ideal place to stay when visiting the 02 like we were as it is only one tube stop away 
 The bed mattress was old and sagged in the middle not good for my back and 3 uncomfortable nights of restless sleep I prefer a firm bed and the pillows were too thick so bad for my neck No Positive
 Room was a little more Shabby than Chic and Restaurant Jenny s felt a bit 1970s Holiday Camp I was upgraded but felt I d overpaid  Staff and public areas excellent Restaurant Jennys food quality good 
 Staff where rude the room was dirty and in a very tied state stains of the carpets and chairs beds where cheap and uncomfortable Breakfast was not worth 13 biggest waste of money DO NOT STAY HERENo Positive
 as me and a friend went got 2 single beds mattress was springy and really small ok for a child but not an adult I kept waking up thinking I was falling out bad night sleep Everything was to expectations
 We had a lovely time but on next morning of important meeting my colleague got trapped in bath room as lock on door was very old broken She was locked bath room for 30 mins she was upset late for important meeting very dangerous door locks need badly updating very upsetting  Rooms clean good views
 There were a few stains on the carpet The room was also quite cold even though I had the heating set at 26 degrees  Bed was comfortable bathroom was clean excellent location for 02 Arena Staff were friendly and helpful 
 Room wasn t clean bathroom was disgusting old furniture Walls cracking bad paint look like they did a quick patch job on everything NO HEATING at all and was very cold  The set up of the room is nice But
 Poor sized single beds So small I couldn t spread my arms out and had rolled off the bed twice The air conditioning fans were loud and you could hear traffic all night i m not one for complaining but this is by far one of the worst hotels I ve stayed in for a while Location wasn t to bad
 The Hotel itself stands out like a saw thumb because it is dated inside and out compared to the surrounding buildings and could do with a major face lift The rooms are very dark and could do with being brightened up and also have more lights put in them  The Location is perfect for anyone wanting to stay in Canary Wharf and commute to Excel and the surrounding areas even central London etc because the DLR and Jubilee Line has a great service 
 breakfast was really not worth the money I chose to go out for breakfast the 2nd day even tho i paid for it on the hotel I wonder if you have checked it out yourself the scrambled eggs were taistless I wonder how you managed to even remove the egg taist Same with the boiled eggs when the yellow inside the egg turns blue it is because they are more than done In general I have to say your breakfast was the worst I have ever had on any hotels I have been to which is quite a few I didnt like when i revervated and gave my creditcard credentials that when i get there the fee has gone up with what is equivalent with 12 pounds you need to lock the price when a customer reservate a room so I dont hve to pay more than what was my initial agreement No Positive
 Heating in the room wasn t working I was provided with a portable heater The room service meal was cold had to return it and get another hot one The food wasn t tasty it was a burger the salad was limp and the mushrooms were boiled  Amazing views clean comfortable bed slept well
 I asked a week earlier for room away from DLR but didn t get it it was noisy and the window was part open by a poor dodgy DIY job Pipes made strange noises Guests at dinner were handling the cheese no fork with the cheese knife The hotel was looking aged Surprised there are rooms for smokers No free wifi  Location good apart from DLR next to it Warm hotel Staff were friendly 
 This is the second time staying here and both times we haven t been given much of a warm greeting This type of welcoming makes the relationship between staff and client uncomfortable  The rooms and hotel itself are very clean and comfortable I like the furniture and design very much plus the view 
 Very rude night manager Pretending he is a nightclub bouncer A terrible welcome by all staff no smiles No hello nothing Like a prison camp Breakfast chef is a lovely engaging individual
 Everything else The building is tackiy tatty and tired The inside needs full refurbishment The charge for parking was disgraceful this is the hotel parking The breakfast was very disappointing indeed  The bed was comfortable The waitress in the pizzaria was very pleasant and helpful One receptionist was not rude 
 We stayed here back in 1994 when it was only about 1 1 2 years old and it was a 1st rate hotel then It s gone downhill since the breakfast food was poor scrambled eggs tasted like they were made from powdered eggs selection was unhealthy very fatty fried ham croissants were stale toast okay fresh fruit okay The furniture in the rooms looked original from 1992l but broken knobs on dressers original wall paper peeling paint peeling Mattresses were firm inexpensive kind Okay but not great  Hotel was clean very good price if paid for online Good price is tradeoff for not the best food or quality of room 
 Very narrow bed constant noise from the fan and from the outside since window couldn t be closed properly Heating broken and had to resort to small spaceheater  Very clean reasonable walking distance to the tube 
 Being told by a male member of staff at reception what a dump of a hotel I had arrived to For the price I paid hospitality of all the other staff the facilities and size and cleanliness of my room I was really happy and would definitely recommend it  Very helpful female staff at reception
 We couldn t open the window or turn the air con to a desired level which meant that we were extremely hot all night  Lovely hotel looks quite grand and is situated not far from the tube station bars restaurants and the water 
 old furniture expensive wifi internet connection no omelet station at breakfast time very close to my work area showing football game in the pub at ground floor
 Christmas song playing at breakfast time in February Room heating could have been warmer Disappointing that wifi is charged as an extra these days  Rooms are a good size for a city hotel with traditional furnishings Great view of Canary wharf area with large picture window Transport links and location excellent for 02 visit Comfortable beds and a good buffet breakfast 
 The bed was particularly uncomfortable and made a good nights sleep impossible Also the final bill incorrectly had 10 added to it which took 15 minutes to sort out when I was in a rush The reception staff did not know what to do  Location
 Stayed a Sunday night and restaurants in hotel closed  Very convenient for working in Canary Wharf Comfortable enough but rooms a bit tired Good value for the rate I paid 
 The room needed a little more redecoration but this is a minor cosmetic issue If the breakfast was cheaper I would have gladly dined in  VERY good value for money A very clean and spacious building that boasts an aging grace whilst retaining elegance amidst plethora of surrounding and newer hotel chains My room was comfortable well facilitated and complimented the hotel style which I appreciated The hotel is well situated near Canary Wharf and other DLR stations 
 They had pathetic staff who couldn t answer basic question about the Internet service they were providing I had to pay twice for getting the Internet activated on my laptop  Nothing really besides the location 
 Hotel was very noisy very dirty smelly bedroom smelly lift very old furniture stains on the wall very rude staff this hotel does not deserve more than 2 stars  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
 bad comfortable mattress toilet paper better quality the hotel was lovely everything to a good standard clean and the staff extremely only fault was the bed was far to hard and the toilet paper was of very poor quality not at all in keeping with the rest of the hotel standards may seem silly to mention but it s true
 Staff were quite snobbish on my arrival Restaurant was closed Bed not the most comfortable 20 mins a day of free WiFi  Conveniently located easy to get to local transport Good sized room Nice shower 
 Air conditioning was not working Car park paid for as requested on checking in but parking penalty notice issued for some reason which I am challengingNo Positive
 Furniture and decor all very dated tired and not particularly clean Carpets all threadbare and worn Beauty salon was closed so no therapy sessions available on our stay Previous guests rubbish not cleared properly from room Bedroom with a window but it was filthy so not that beneficial  Lounge area clean and tidy staff welcoming and helpfull Spa pool gym facilities all looked good though not used Breakfast good but not fantastic Great location with easy access gateway tube and DLR restaurants and shopping very close by 
 Nothing I can think of  We really enjoyed our stay The cleanliness of the hotel was excellent and the beds were really comfortable Staff were very pleasant We would go back 
 Dated decor generally drab The owners have obviously stopped trying  Grubby dated and expensive for what you get Embarrassing to come from Rome and Paris where the hotels are of such a superior quality to your home country and squalor when booking remember if you are coming from Heathrow you ll need a car To park a car is 21 pounds a day at this hotel and wifi costs 6 pounds a day per device 
 Bedrooms worn and mattresses uncomfortable I travel all over the place and will be in and out of this hotel for the next few months I ve been giving different rooms each time and deffo some better than others and by a huge difference Mattress need replacing and the temperature of the room depends if you don t mind holding your door open for 10 minutes to the corridor to allow some air as they are all way too hot  Ease of location
 I was given a room close to the lifts elevators so I could hear loud steel like noise every time one of the lifts elevators passed my floor and the noise levels decreased only around 3am and started again at 6 30am the room was very dirty dust everywhere including dusty bed linen dirty carpet sticky remote control brown smears on bathroom walls mold near the bathtub and stained bathroom floor The tea making facilities cups not washed properly the kettle was covered in white residue I raised the issues with hotel reception staff and I was offered no help nor an apology I got in touch with the customer services but they have never replied to my email It was traumatising experience and do not recommend Britannia Hotel in Docklands to anyone  Location few min walk to Canary Wharf station
No Negative When arriving the staff were very pleasant and helpful We were upgraded and had a fantastic room with brilliant views of canary wharf We would defiantly stay at this hotel again 
 I didn t like the shower at all It wasn t working properly and I only realised this thr next day an hour before my check out therefore I couldn t change rooms etc  I liked the bed it was comfortable The cleanliness of the room was very good 
 Sound proofing in the room was up late 12 1 because of a loud couple next door Many items of the breakfast was cold a bit upsetting  View was beautiful Room was nice
 Hotel is lack lustre in its approach and parts were very dirty The restaurant and bar areas were filthy and the breakfast room reeked of old fat I could not eat there at all and in fact on one of the days bought my evening meal at the local Tescos location near to business meetings for 3 days
 Staff letting themselves into the room at 8am when we was asleep Check out is 11am so no need for them to enter before then  Views are amazing and very good value
 The spa we were told that the last entry was at 6pm and ended at 7pm but in fact it closed at 6 30 pm and the other half hour was to get you out of the spa you should be more specific about this the swimming pool tiles along the top part of the water were very dirty and needed a good clean I think that the steam room thermostat was broken as it was so hot that you couldn t stay in there for more than a couple of minutes and the only sauna that I have been to that doesn t have a drinking fountain I had to go through spa reception to the gym to get water leaving a trail of water behind me Finally you should get your staff to smile just a little bit  We had a free upgrade which is always a bonus only 10 15 minute walk to the underground station the Hotel and room were clean although a little tired looking but what you would expect from a busy hotel comfortable bed ok breakfast we would stay here again 
 Pool and so a were very poor and not clean at all ovetall3 10 For breakfast an Asian guy who was serving tea or coffee was so rude and not happy to work The manager was so pleased to work and young lad was working with his jacket it was cold and seems so strange and not professional at all Breakfast choices were excellent overall 6 10No Positive
 WiFi is only free in the lobby and it s 7 for WiFi in your room which in this day and age is very outdated  With the glitz and glamour on the outside and a fine welcome this hotel is perfect for a quick getaway for smokers who wish to chill rooms where a bit dated like most of the hotel but it was a fine for people wishing to smoke and drink the night away in your own room Perfect Spice hahahaha was not even open pizza place pretty decent as the bar Recommended for all walks of life 
 The bed was not comfortable the room was filthy the was were stained the bath was dirty the carpet was dirty and sticky the lift and several floor smelt like cannibis the couple next to us were arguing all night the room was stuffy Found a weed cigarette on the floor and rubbish under the bed The staff were not friendly I d strongly advise anyone staying here I could of booked a less known hotel for half the price and double the standards Just diagustingNo Positive
 The was not teeth brush and paste on the bathroom The views are really good We could see the london eye and tower bridge from our room There is a building blocking part of it but its better than a lot of hotels The staff are really polite and nice and the bar prices are acceptable
 In the room we stayed in was full of dust and the bedding had hair on which was not the colours of mine or my sisters hair which we had to remove the hot tap in our room was broken and the stay overnight was very noisy glad it was only one nightNo Positive
 Booked a smoking room when i got there it wasnt Nd was explained to that they only offer twin room smoking rooms not double rooms false advertisement No little biscuits or chocolate with tea and coffee like other hotels Other than that all good Beds and view were lovely And was surprisingly quiet
 The fact that the staff lied about my room I booked a double bed for my other half and me got two single mattresses pushed together which done my back in Worst night sleepNo Positive
 Rude personnel prostitutes on the floor and even though we made complains about noise we ve been told to change hotel  There s nothing to add in this bracket
 The cold the place was freezing the room was freezing the bar area was freezing generally a cold sprited hotel Wouldn t recommend and most defo won t be returning The bed was comfy
 20 mins free wifi was disappointing and the view wasn t great with some construction noise when I arrived  Great location clean comfortable good facilities gym pool bar restaurant and more options outside the hotel 
 The staff are so rude Especially the girls at reception I was then accused of smoking in my room So I had 2 gentleman knock on my door saying the housekeeper could smell smoke I don t even smoke Which they then apologised for Excellent stay apart from the rude staff  The view was amazing 
 It took me quite a while to find the hotel at the start but once I found it it was so easy to find again When I first arrived there was a blonde receptionist and she was very rude to me and unhelpful But the other staff were lovely In my room there was air conditioning but it was set to a particular setting and it was far too hot In the evenings the room would get quite clammy which wasn t nice But overall would stay again  I loved the location Literally 2 minutes walk from the Canary Wharf station The room was lovely aswell I had booked a single room without a window Because it was the cheapest and they put me in a room with a window which I thought was lovely 
 Lack of access to free wifi in the room It was very discomforting Free wifi which one has to refresh every 30mins was only available at the lobby The bed was ok and the space was just comfortable
 The overground was very loud and could be heard through the night and early morning  Good value for money and good location for links into central London 
 The decor was very dated and this made staying in the hotel uncomfortable Staff were friendly though and the location was good good value for money  Good value for money 
 Slow service at reception bar and restaurant Cold in atmosphere and temperature Worst hotel I have stayed in for a long time Never again  Departure 
 I was SEXUALLY HARRASSED in the lobby of the hotel on my way to the hotel gym An unsightly man wearing a baseball cap and gold tooth seated on the couch who was not staying in the hotel hissed at me when I walked by He was not staying in the hotel and had made his way in there and was reclining on the couch I went to the front desk and I had to ask they call management to remove him they were very slow and a bit of a careless attitude like they were used to this They asked me to go to the gym and they would take care of him and I insisted to wait to see him removed They were very SLOW to act The guy came out and confronted me and we had an exchange of words while the manager was standing in front of me Proper management should have had zero tolerance for harassment and not let it get to that level and not let him the guy speak to me again I was very scared and uncomfortable The hotel is located close to the East End which is not a good neighborhood according to a local friend Do NOT stay in this hotel I DO NOT recommend it No Positive
 They messed up my reservation The person that checked me in told me I am able to smoke in my room however I went upstairs and I see a non smoking sign on my door So I went back down to speak about it and they told me its all my fault and they were very rude They seem like they were not very bothered with what I was saying Worse hotel I have stayed at Would not recommend this to anyone  Views were good 
 Coffee should be served and not sitting in old Jugs Wifi in this day an age should be free and when u pay you cant even transfer device Joke I stayed in Holiday express Stratford and they were pretty much the same difference was however a 100 pounds Location
 Personnel was very rude Housekeeping staff don t have basic knowledge of English Even when we have put DND sign on the door they have stormed I to the room with the vacuum cleaner while I was having a bath 4 times When I have made complain at the reception regarding this incident I haven t received any apologies but I have also been told that if I don t like it I can always change the hotel  Location was very good to commute within Canary Wharf area
 The hotel has become quite tired the rooms could do with a little updating but we do appreciate it would be a mammoth task and I do believe they are already undertaking improvement works  We have stayed at this hotel many times over the course of the past 20 years or so I think that says it all really 
 I booked this hotel because of the Gym and Spa only to find on a Sunday it closes at 7pm Hotel looks tired can do with up dating Food and service was good
 The original room we were give had a drafty window and electric heater in the room as it was cold When asked to be moved the staff tried to fob us off but with a lot of persisstance they moved us to a non drafty room  Like the location and facilities 
 Shame one of the restaurants was shut but with two more on site it wasn t a deal breaker  Good location great price and staff very helpful had a room with a nice view of Canary Wharf to boot 
 room way too warm with fixed thermostat at a constant 27 8 why Room service long long wait In house catering facilities back in 80 s location price
 Uncomfortable old bed and the springs would pop and ping with every movement Definitely needs replacing No fridge or bottles of water in the room The TV lost signal and cut out every few seconds Receptionist staff didn t even ask whether we had a pleasant stay when we checked out maybe because they don t often get a positive response to that question  Walking distance to canary wharf
 Single beds were a bit of a disappointment Luckily I had to be up early otherwise the noise of the DLR outside the window at 6am would have annoyed me  Perfect location for working in Canary Wharf 
 12pm check out would have been handy  The staff were friendly on check in The location was good for the O2 as we were in London for a gig The room was spacious and although the bathroom was quite old fashioned it was clean and there were lots of toiletries 
 high price with hardly working facilities wifi in rooms used to be free before and it is now charged separately for business traveler wifi is a must in room and not in lobby even in lobby it keeps getting disconnected every 20 mins crazy wifi facility health club is required for business users to relax the stressed out day that is also separately charged  closeness to canary wharf business center
 the only downsize is that the breakfast starts only at 7 00 am would be great if Britannia could reconsider to serve the breakfast at 6 30am especially when people staying for business reason and want to start their day at the office early also quite poor selection for someone who eats healthy there is no options so going forward if I ever stay I won t book breakfast with my room booked single room have been upgraded to family room great location only 15 minutes walking distance to all banks
 Food was dry and tasteless Beds quite uncomfortable and should be changed Sheets had holes Musty scent in the air Smells quite old No free Internet outside of the lobby which even cheaper hotels provide Everything seems to be DIY or you pay a surcharge The staff refused to help with luggage and simply point to where the elevators are There was overall no warmth  The location was the only good part of the hotel As well as the lobby
 I have been paying for car parking 21 however the parking area not secure place my car some one been panting something beside passenger door it was annoyed me  Notting 
 Rooms are getting a bit old and are in need of cleaning properly Table tops not wiped Ingrained dirt in some places Dust in others Shower nozzle only allows narrow stream  Location at Canary Wharf 
 When booking I asked for parking if breakfast was included I didn t get a reply When I got there I was charged 21 for parking no breakfast included I wasn t informed about this prior to my visit The shower had mould around the bath  Location
 The room was rather cold upon arrival but there was a stand alone heater in the room which warmed it up nicely The room was a little dated handles missing off draws non matching furniture but this somewhat added to the character of the place P I liked the size of the room It was spacious and enough room for all my things 
 Breakfast was appalling as was the lack of service from the staff The TV remote didn t work and nor did the bin in the bathroom The Spice restaurant was also closed which was a shame Very poor customer service as majority didn t hear one English member of staff could barely speak english  We had an upgraded room without asking which was very spacious with a large window overlooking the water Excellent location 
 1 Local trains DLR very noisy even though we were on the 10th floor Not pleasant after a late night to be woken very early by the noise of the trains will invest in ear plugs in future 2 WiFi in rooms charged Surprising in 2016 even budget chains provide free WiFi nowadays 3 Additional charge of 10 00 per hour for later check outs 4 Expensive bar prices  Fairly close 5 10 mins walk from Canary Wharf tube depending on fitness Room large and spacious Staff helpful and pleasant 
 The car park was very expensive  Really enjoyed our stay Breakfast was fab Room nice and big and clean and staff were helpful View from window over the city was amazing too 
 the room next to us had their bed back to back with ours and we could hear loud talking during the night  The room was very clean the bar was lovely and relaxing The bed was very comfy and the TV was great 
 Tried to go back and price gone up from 55 to 85 on Monday 225 on Tuesday and 225 on Wednesday so have booked into premier inn now and for the next 3 months for 224 for 3 nights each week The price
 We requested to pay prior the stay due to payment being made on company credit card which is in my name I was advised to email reception which I did twice 2 different email addresses both bounced back Reception staff were very unhelpful My colleague ended paying on his personal credit card very inconvenient We will not be staying again No Positive
 The room next door were very loud I slept half an hour all night On telling the staff they asked them to be quiet but I received no compensation  The cleanliness Location was ideal for me Close to exchange tower 
 The rooms were quite dated for our tastes in terms of the pictures and wall colours Shower was hard to adjust to a pleasant temperature Large spacious room at the hotel based in a nice setting in Canary Wharf Entrance was welcoming and staff were friendly
 I emailed 3 x regarding the gym use and facilities and no one got back to me Very poor customer service Me and my partner wanted to use the gym and sauna facilities but no response was heard No Positive
 The hotel has really dated since the last time we went a few years ago From entering the car park which had old doors scrap bits of carpet and broken glass to the smell of damp in the rooms It s a real shame as to the condition it has turned too  location
 Fixtures and fittings seemed old and dated could do with a refurb However at the price paid it was no problem decent value  Location is very good and tube station 5 minute walk away for getting around the city Views of canary wharf from the rooms was great 
 Decor very old and dated staff unhelpful tried to charge us wrong won t stay again headboard coming off bed broken light only one tea bag and one coffee for drink Being in canary whalf we often stay in London around canary whale but not the britannia again
 Staff were rude Pizzeria food was terrible 7 for WiFi seems tad extortionate And should of mentioned that you have to pay for swimming and gym facilities Decor dated but easily overlooked had rest of stay been more comfortable Location
 This hotel is in need of a major refurb smelly corridors water marks in the room worn carpets Twin rooms do have 2 single beds in them but they are really narrow and right next to each other so you need to be good friends with your room mate I asked for a different room but was advised that I had the biggest  Large room
 The standard of room the view of the generators from my second floor window the minimal amounts of tea and coffee in the room the lack of English speaking staff rudeness of staff and totally being ignored at breakfast then having to seat ourselves and lay our own tables Leaving
 Indian restaurant within the hotel is dreadful 8 people in when we visited and it took and hour and a half to serve us a meal which was awful  Room was clean and spacious with a very comfy bed
 Staff are miserable Room was noisey because of Heron Quay tubes going past Some poo like stains on fresh towels Windows are old and rattly and do not close properly When neighbouringing room is having a wee every last drop can be heard and I also counted 3 plops and 2 flush attempts  Location is great Views are good 
 The single beds in the twin room were narrower than normal but comfortable  Clean great bar area cheerfull staff great location close to tube Great breakfast
 The outside was a little shabby and unkempt round the back near the water Windows were dirty  Breakfast was really good a good choice of food and well presented 
 I was very much looking forward to spending a great deal of my stay in your spa but unfortunately was very dissapointed on my first visit and did not return Visiting my local spa on a daily basis I was really looking forward to what I assumed would be a great relaxing experience The pool was cold so was the jacuzzi the steam room was not working properly and the doorvwas continuously open as the thermostat was apparently broken We really enjoyed the experience of the hotel but this spa let it down big time The view from our room was exceptional the room was very warm and comfortable and very clean
 The night staff how I was spoken to after arriving my first time in a hotel they wasn t accommdating at all But the morning staff were nice and accommdating The decor of the room was excellent and everything about it was really lovely
 The breakfast option was awful They had chips in with the beans the sausages were cold The bacon was also cold When reported the staff did not seem to bothered about the situation We ended up having to go elsewhere as the breakfast was just not acceptable We spoke to other guest of the hotel that evening and they agreed all the same Poor customer serviceNo Positive
 The shower head fell apart when trying to use it alongside it being inside the bath to stand Bed was reasonably comfy whole room was dated and used looking  Very large room with big windows for natural light Large bathroom and bath perfect for couples 
 Noisy The trains run until very late and then again early morning I stayed in room 1130 Views were great but sleep wasn t Also no free pool or room wi fi as suggested  The location is perfect for Canada Square Walk over the bridge then you are pretty much there 
No Negative rooms were clean tea coffee facilities in bedroom and toiletries available in bathroom Didn t use pool spa so no comment Breakfast buffet good choice of food available 
 The decor is very dated and the rooms could do with some modernisation  The location was perfect for my stay as I had one day of business to do in Canary Wharf But was just a short tube journey to some of the tourist attractions e g Tower of London
 Nothing Staff very friendly efficient Check in quick simple Room on 9th floor clean tidy with great view Few mins walk to underground Didn t spend much time in hotel can t comment on food but all in all good value hotel
 After we checked in and went to the room we saw a worn down rug The bathroom had mold between the tiles and the bath tub had worn out spots  The staff service was not bad 
No Negative Absoulutly everything about this trip was amazing Thank you so much for having us Britannia was a pleasure to be in your hotel See you again soon with a lovely warm welcome Thank you 
 The whole building is tatty and tired The carpets are tapes down in reception lifts are rattled and all the woodwork is scraped back down to wood Windows are filthy and the odd shapes room quirky but not in a good way TV on room 1100 is placed on an angles wall and the TV so small for the distance you need binoculars As for the pizzeria thick base and not cooked All the way though Really disappointed They do have a spa but did not try this so I am unable to comment  Location was good for Canary Wharf 
 Rude reception desk at check in Didn t acknowledge my existence or make eye contact once Checkout female was pleasant and efficient Room was 16degrees and didn t hear up beyond 18 all night Room service was cold pizza and tasted awful Bath towels like hand towels Face missing from taps Dirty grout around bath Other than that it was great not  Location
 A mirror destroyed the view the desk fall apart when open a draw next draw the same Dirty marks on wallpaper shabby bathroom not a 4 star hotel at all  the price the location the view
 hotel is tired and needs a facelift towels were not what expected for the price too much emphasis on getting the money rather than the service generally the staff were helpful
 I think at breakfast there should be somebody meeting and staggering the guest as we came down there was nobody there and when we got to the food there was a massive que and not enough food for the amounts of guest lining up Also when the staff come to replenish the good should ensure their uniform are clean we saw one member with a dirty bloodied apron on pretty off putting when trying to eat  Views from room great
 Very dated hotel Temperature was unbearable 30 degrees and no way to turn it down The staff had to come and unscrew the window open so we could sleep Breakfast was poor quality  The bed was very comfortable
 Wanted food but the restaurant was closed so asked main reception for a number for take away and he was very unhelpful and didn t provide help just said don t knowNo Positive
 The layout of the facilities in the bathroom wasn t well planned The shower leaked because the curtain fixing wasn t positioned well Staff at the reception desk didn t appear very well clued up or attentive as repeated questions asked  Clean room and sufficient for the purpose of an overnight stay in the city Easy to get to work the following morning 
 Very tired looking hotel with frayed carpets and old plumbing service very slow impersonal in the Bar in the evenings  Location also staff gave me a free upgrade in room size due to regular stays 
 A little out dated vintage style is good but too much can be depressing Throw some more modern tech style and will be perfect  Cleanliness staff and security
 Couldn t get wifi And sadly the bed was to soft for my liking Breakfast was lovely Apart from the none fresh crossiants  Close to station Lovely big room Nice view 
 Booked a double room without window At reception told it was a queen size Got to the room it was a Twin Was too tired to go back to reception to complain  Very comfortable hotel Always perfect regardles of wrong room type this time 
 Could make sure the taps had tops and do some minor maintenance of this type  Location pool long resaurant hours restaurant food variety Water views from room 
 It is an old cheap 4 stars hotel Decoration is dated the gym is terrible my room had dirty windows in the exterior Awful breakfast Location is very good though  The location is great easy access to public transportation and Canary Wharf Mall 
 Rooms were too hot and air conditioning was not working I reported this to reception after the first night and was told an engineer would look at it I came back from work nothing done so it was reported again The fix was to put a fan in my room did not get much sleep the 4 nights I stayed Staff were disinterested  Central for working in Canary Wharf 
 The soap dish in bathroom was dirty and rusty carpets threadbare and stained Breakfast was a disappointment dry hard bacon food lukewarm and dry Water for tea tepid Dissatisfied as previously breakfast good  Lovely views can recommend eve buffet 
 constant low frequency noise coming from somewhere around not a big deal as we did managed to fall a sleep and we stayed on night only  good hotel good location
 Hotel really needs a renovation it seems like it hasn t been updated in 10 15 years and that there are no plans for godfather The bedding etc is clean but other aspects need work as they appear extremely worn Location is great as your into central London very quickly on the tube 2 3 stops Value for money 
 my hotel room was looking a little bit tired not shabby but just coming up to needing a refurbishment I think when the Novotel hotel that is currently Jan 2016 being built opposite opens this hotel will have some very strong competition  The hotel breakfast buffet is pretty good I never got time to try out the pool sadly it closes at 7pm and I never made it back in time to try it fairly close to the public transport 
 Only slight negative comment is that the bath towels really could do with being a bit bigger  It s very local to work and several colleagues use this hotel The restaurant s food is very good and room service is always prompt and reasonably priced 
 The staff are extremely rude and in helpful especially the managers Some of the reception staff are rude and blunt I have a few friends who have stayed at the hotel and most people I know say the same Also have heard a few disagreements with reception staff  Great hotel lovely food fast room service Wonderful location and nice sized rooms with great views 
 Location was an excellent I was just disappointed with the staffs from reception as they were asking for my ID and all constantly Despite of showing my lisence they weren t happy for some reason Also they took more than half and hour to sort it out I wasn t happy at all but moreover I loved it  Location was an excellent 
 IT Was further from Canary Wharf as to get there we need to cross a bridge and no signs where hotel is the main entrance is on the back side of the hotel which is just strange The hotel was great I had an iron and the iron desc tea coffee facilities heater hairdryer in my room So comfortable and neat Hotel also offers a pretty big gym and smal pool to relax after work 
 Even the room we had as an upgrade was a bit run down and old fashioned The stairs to the different floors didn t match and had a lot of worn patches  Staff were really helpful and we got a free upgrade
 Taxi service They have a fixed rate of 75 pound to take you to the airport But the taxi driver wanted more He wanted 115 pounds due to traffic he said So be careful Very close to the Canary wharf underground Overal good hotel and good value for money if booked from Bookings Very expensive if booked directly from Hotel
 Having to pay to use the swimming pool The staff were really friendly and helpful lovely breakfast with nice views of the river we enjoyed watching the ducks and birds on the water 
 The mattresses were very hard and not at all comfortable Quite a bit of repetitive noise throughout the night from something mechanical sounding  The location size of bedroom choice of restaurants and cleanliness all excellent
 We were unable to contact the hotel on the number provided and needed to advise of a late arrival Had to go through booking com who also could not get through Wifi in the room was not working  The room was clean and large Bathroom was a good size Overall the room could do with a bit of updating decorating but was good value for money 
No Negative Stayed a few times at this hotel Staff always friendly helpful My room was upgraded to a suite which was lovely with fabulous views of London Only let down was as room was very big could get cold Overall a great stay for the new year 
 The window appeared jammed and we were unable to close it without the need for assistance Abit invasive and an uncomfortable night sleep because of the cold Otherwise fine No Positive
 Room cleaning chaotic and on new years day non existent Did not like being told this fact was on notice board it wasn t Shows the lack of management endemic to the hotel  Large room good storage and well furnished 
 A little noisy at night but that is London so can t really complain  We got a free upgrade to a spacious room with its own balcony and hot tub bath Great location 
 Nothing was not as we wanted it to be The hotel was beautiful Our room was exceptionally lovely big cosy clean warm we loved it so much the hotel entrance was appealing nicely decorated up ft Christmas we ate pizza from the restauranr which was lovely we used the gym we requested change of sheets on day 2 as a result of personal issues and the cleaners were exceptionally polite and catered to my needs preventing undue embarrassment so happy 
 some of the carpets in the hallway on the floor i was on were holed and threadbare and likely to cause an accident apart from creating a bad impression  Location excellent food good room comfortable 
 The beds the staff in the Italian restaurant where really rude and we had hairs in our food The room was freezing and the cleaners kept coming in room when we said not too  The location the bars and the value of money
 It s five star hotel that didn t have heating that worked so they asked if I wanted a portable heater which is some thing you will get in a bed and breakfastNo Positive
 Staff were rude and unhelpful especially the duty manager who did not even care that the breakfast was inedible The breakfast was absolutely appalling dried up bread Luke warm coffee cold food that should have been hot Dirty crockery and cutlery seriously terrible probably the worst dining experience I have ever had in any hotel in the world Followed by a duty manager who simply shrugged his shoulders when told how bad the food was as if to say I don t care  Nice location nice big clean room
 I could hear a lot of noise from the hallway and the room next door When I tried calling concierge twice there was no answer The staff were friendly and the accommodation was clean and served its purpose
 There were some stains on the bathroom wall behind the toilet  4 Star hotel in London for under 60 pounds per night Also got upgraded for free to a room with a view 
 The hotel is a little far from the subway Expensive breakfast  I like the location Canary Wharf because it has facilities it is easy to get around and is a nice place with the river 
 I would say the hotel stag while checking in because they had problems with my provisional liscense as a identity card They told me to bring passport next time and I did but they didn t checked it Overall checking in system staffs in reception were rude and took more than half and hou rish  Location price and cleanliness 
 For the second year running the Britannia have managed to mess up the billing for our rooms by charging one of our group for a room which had already been prepaid The person concerned is a client of ours and it is all very embarrassing Added to which it is now 2nd January and I still haven t had a response to my request for a refund having stayed there on the 15th December  The location 
 Staff and management didn t use their discretion No wi fi in the room even though it was advertised A C didn t work the entire time They didn t resolve the issue Location
 The bed was too hard so didn t sleep well The air conditioning didn t work so we was hot all night The old man on reception was miserable very unfriendly The room was spacious clean
 OMG the heat in the room was terrible 29 5 degrees and the windows do not open To cool the room you need to turn the air con on full fan makes a hell of a noise and so never slept all weekend Heat or noise both unbearaBLE Avoid peak times for restaurant queue for 40 mins Pillows rock hard Very clean and sparkly new and modern
 we was in room 1137 i did not expect a train track about 100ft from my pillow the track was ok it was the trains running 24 hours a day every 10mis it was a nightmare we could not sleep the location was perfect the staff was great
 I was not informed at the receprionist desk about the terms of parking The lift service was quite slow in the morning Other cars were not parked in marked parking spaces to making manouveribg quite uneasy No Positive
 Bed was hard and the heating was stuck on 25 degrees and couldn t be turned down when I asked at reception the best they could do was open a window No Positive
 There seems to be always someone from the reception staff that leaves a bad impression that nearly eclipses the memory of all the others which are really good and helpful The rooms could use some minor work seems like the place has aged and someone forgot that it could use some renovation work light switches wallpaper minor bruises and bumps Room insonorization would be perfect with the DLR so close  You often just don t notice the good things however the rooms I ve slept in were in pretty good shape and have most needs details covered 
 This is definitely not a four star hotel Dirty toilet stained carpet brown peeling wallpaper v Narrow beds Heating stayed on all night at 27 degrees no air con the bedroom window wouldn t open We eventually had to call housekeeping at 01 00hrs to open it but still no air came in An unattended suitcase left on landing despite me telephoning down for it to be looked at Security threat Overnight parking is 21 00 no reduction for residents you pay the same as man on the street Crowded breakfast dining room with tatty seats rusty windows unfriendly staff Unappetising food fatty undercooked bacon over ripe fruit general poor selection of food and display unfriendly staff treated us as inconvenience rather than guests Dirty breakfast table Leisure facilities which are not as good as they appear in photos shut at 16 00hrs we had not be informed that this would happen when we booked We has specifically booked hotel for spa facility However looking at the murky state of the pool we probably wouldn t have risked entering that or any spa facility they provided for risk of infection We upgraded to an excutive room with the promise of a view and was given a view of a rubbish dump in one direction and a building site in the other Photos can be provided but they are not pleasant to look at I did bring all these points up with manager both at the beginning and end of our stay and received a very basic apology I got the feeling that manager felt if I didn t like it bad luck there was no offer of a part refund to compensate for our unpleasant stay I doubt if anything will change It was a very very disappointing stay and I would not stay there again  I can t think of anything I liked 
 Attitude of staff was poor No safe in room no water in room no glasses in room no fridge in room Not able to make any phone calls from hotel local or otherwise Tried to use swimming pool at 1815 to be told that although pool closed at 1900 we had to be in pool by 1800 Crap Next day we were in pool at 1830 and people still coming in All staff were east Euopeans whose knowledge and understanding of English varied from average to woeful non existant An International hotel I don t think so Oh and the till in the bar didn t work Think Fawlty Towers and you ll have some idea A joke of an hotel Wyn Lam is the manager who was conspicuopus by his her absence No Positive
 Thermostat was set too high 28c tried in vain to lower using the air con fan but it should be more efficient or instructions provided Expected toothpaste and complementary bottled water to be provided  Clean and large Given a window room despite only paying for room without a window Comfy bed and good shower 
 breakfast was not included in the whole stay so we had to purchase it separately and in the end it was not tasty all not a big variety of stuff that you can actually eat No Positive
 The decor is looking a bit tired and worn and could do with a refresh Lack of UK sockets at the bed side made using medical equipment a little tricky The breakfast was pat its prime and not appetizing I wouldn t recommend paying the extra for breakfast  Really convenient location with good check in staff 
 No temperature control in the room Vermin running around the bar area Vermin running around the restaurant Being charged to park your car Breakfast location
 Serving breakfast so late when your location is in the centre of London s financial district is ridiculous Staff could be more friendly  High quality room good sleep 
 I did not want to come away two days before Christmas with insect bites ALL OVER MY TOES AND LEGS TO TOP OF THIGH ARMS CHEEKS AND NECK THE BEDROOM CARPETS ALSO HAD INSECTS WHICH WERE BITING ON THE FEET AND LEGS AS WE SAT ON THE CHAIR WATCHING THE VIEWS FROM OUR WINDOW  location
 It could do with a refurb but it did a job for me as I was just looking for a bed for the night but would have been disappointed if I have stayed there with my wife Location and staff were friendly
 See above We are regular visitors the room temp was 29 degrees could not open a window so they gave us a fan took 2days to give it and the bed was a large single shower was either biking hot or cold room number 1130 I have emailed then but have no reply back as yet I just think sad that we experience a baking room small bed and mind of its own shower but we didn t let it dampen our spirits staff was friendly and approachable
 staff couldn t be bothered and weren t helpful had to pay 21 for parking under hotel car park was also charged for swimming pool facility 4 when in other hotels it is included and 10 each breakfast extra charges for everything not happy the room was good and location good staff were not helpful we chose the hotel for the swimming pool and were charged for a swim and also for breakfast
 Everywhere was brown and dull and dark It s so depressing as a guest a lot of the rooms don t have a nice view so have large curtains and sheer netting which is perfectly fine but due to the colour of the furniture etc it doesn t feel like there s enough sunlight You should maximise the potential of the rooms by making them less dreary dark brown is depressing and the rooms just feel really dingy because of this Staff were polite room was big
No Negative The hotel is not exceptional but the service was swift and polite on check in and out and the room was tidy and comfortable This was excellent value for money in a prime Canary Wharf location The prices vary but when they are at their keenest this is one of the best value hotels in London 
 Staff was very rude the man on the front desk was no help when I had a problem left in tears Breakfast was rubbish hard cold and tasteless Beds are cozy view is amazing
 Horrible decor and rooms showing their age peeling wallpaper worn fittings I last stayed here 17 years ago and it feels like it has not changed  Good location for Canary Wharf Good price for a London room 
 Room was a little too warm for our liking There was a thermostat and fan control but it didn t allow us to cool the room enough Lovely location clean spacious and comfortable Great value for money we stayed in the twin executive room 
 Uncomfortable beds room too hot windows don t open Car parking system is enter your reg no at reception and pay for the number of days you re staying The problem is trying to extend the duration you either have to pay at a machine coins only or pay by phone which entails setting up an account and giving some anonymous person your bank details In the end I left and parked in West India Quay for half the price  Location
 Staff could be more friendly and the hotel feels a bit too old but it s nothing terrible No WiFi and an extra charge for a safety deposit box were annoying  Very convenient location especially if you have to work at Canary Wharf 
 I m sure when it first opened it must have been a great hotel but now the rooms feel a bit dated Beds were not that comfortable and towels rough No Positive
 Have stayed here quite a few times booked single room as usual and this time I was put into some sort of converted room on the 1st floor Cold air continually blowing down and no way of controlling it Eventually contacted reception to complain They suggested I put the heating on I informed them the heating didn t work Ended up changing rooms around midnight Manager in the morning not prepared to do anything  I enjoyed being able to use the exit door in the morning
 Rooms are tired and could do with redecoration I stayed in an executive room the shower was antiquated the tap at the bathroom sink malfunctioned and caused a mini flood the room was much too hot and after waiting 20 minutes to check in I was given a non smoking room after requesting a smoking room in advance  Conveniently located for Boisdale Jazz restaurant where we had a great time 
 We were upgraded to the 13th floor after the room we were given already had someone in it much to his suprise when we walked in Really tired room Worst shower ever Breakfast was not much better Really needs a refit  Reception staff very good 
 The Staff is very low standard working with no smile on their faces unhelpful and almost rude Plus every extra is charged breakfast with a scandalous price gym pool phone internet Unfortunately not to repeat  The room was extremely comfortable 
 The room was not as clean as it should have been there was a fan on in the room that made a noise all night unable to find the switch to turn this off  Location
 The hotel was advertised as within close proximity of the o2 arena Although the website states it is 0 8 miles from the o2 arena this is as the crow flies and across the Thames To walk to the arena is an hour and a half walk or 20 in a taxi The shower had very low water pressure and did not maintain a temperature The flush on the toilet did not work The maid knocked on our door at 10 30 and started shouting leaving Leaving Whilst we were trying to get dressed for check out at 11am No Positive
 The room was cold and had to put electric heater on also the ceiling fan was noisy all the time need free wifi in rooms as its expensive just for one device the hotel could do with updating as the fixtures and fittings are a bit dated Easy access to Canary Wharf and in a good location
 Disappointed that i did not get what i requested found receptionist unhelpful on arrival Hotel reception area could do with some brighning up also bedrooms could do with some tlc room was too warm and found difficult to regulate the air condition  Room very comfortable slept very well even though room was a little too warm but did enjoy our stay and would stay again 
 The hotel is in dire need of renovation My room was shabby and the carpet dirty The bathroom was in a very poor state and the shower woefully inadequate The bed was uncomfortable in the extreme and every spring could be felt through the mattress The walls were paper thin and the noise from the DLR despite the room being on the 11th floor was unbearable making sleep impossible while the trains were running Unsurprisingly the staff didn t ask if everything was alright with my stay  Convenient location 
 The parking space was shocking and expensive The staff was not helpful or accommodating to a guest who is paying a lot of money to stay in the hotel I asked if I could check out 1 hour later and they told me no problem but I needed to pay extra for it I find this ridiculous never happened to me in other hotels of better standard and quality  The facilities were good and the hotel in general was clean The room was spacious and had a very nice view very satisfied with the room even though I still think it is too expensive I enjoyed the room 
 Our room was without a window and it was very cold Would stay here again but upgrade to a more premium room given the chance The Hotel is very clean and the staff are extremely friendly
 The worst hotel I ve been I stayed in the room 249 without possibility of wi fi connection Everything in the room was ancient My coat and dress get crushed in the wardrobe because it was rediculously short  Location convenient during work at Canary Wharf
 Hotel requires proper heating in bar and social gathering areas Mostly new windows required Dampness all over ceilings in said area Hotel need refurbished  Very friendly bar staff 1spanish gentelmen 
 Only a tiny thing really but the tea coffee making facilities 2 teabags 2 coffee sachets in the room could have been a bit more generous  Stayed here before so confident would be what we needed for overnight stay
 The room and bathroom not clean properly heating not working it was so cold despite I turned on maximum The furniture and decoration are very old  Staff and reception area
 Even though the room was Non Smoking and I m sure it has been for a while it still smelt of old smoke WORST shower I have ever had to use in a hotel room  We were given a room on the top floor 1303 facing Canary Wharf so we had great views The room was huge and clean The bed was very comfortable with 4 pillows and more available in the wardrobe Tea Coffee facilities also available 
 Breakfast not so good been before when much better jacuzzi bath did not work properly  Location to the o2 large room with a view Ease of check in 
 Very tired decor This place could do with a closure for 6 months and a grand re opening I was given a room that was supposed to be non smoking and had to walk straight back to reception to ask for a swap because somebody had clearly smoked in it When I eventually got swapped admittedly the room I got was bigger but I may as well have slept in the dlr station the train line is ridiculously close to the rooms on one side of the building and the windows are not sound proofed or even double glazed to attempt to rectify the atrocious noise I didn t sleep until the trains stopped which was about 1 30am given that I had a job interview the next day I was furious about this Paying 70 for the night with no breakfast included is also massively taking the mick Stay at the Premier Inn or Novotel instead people  Convenient location Large room In Canary Wharf 
 I booked a double smoking room and got a non smoking room they changed it but for a twin room not what i wanted  The fact it is one of the only hotels with smoking rooms The decor is warm and plush The staff are helpful and very polite I like this hotel having stayed here before
 The hotel is a little tired and needs to be given a bit of a facelift The spa bath did not look very clean and the taps in the bathroom were quite eroded Timing on breakfast as was very busy and staff not able to keep up with clearing  Good location entrance is nice huge bed good selection of things at breakfast
 we booked a double room and got a twin room instead our room had no windows and felt suffocated and the bathroom decor was dated and looked like a swimming pool  location very convenient 
 In this level of hotel breakfast should be an enjoyable experience shown to table served coffee and asked whether you need anything This was not the case with a 20min queue to get hot food  Good Location close to public transport tube bus or boat On entering gave the impression of a grand hotel and professionally run Cosy rooms with good views on the river side Enjoyed a glass of wine and nibbles looking over the Thames
 Bed was tiny just about catered for two adults shower was useless couldn t get a decent temperature and the power was woeful didn t feel clean at all after Bar closed way to early for a Saturday 13 50 for a all u can eat breakfast which was dry and over cooked and 4 for a bottle of water Over 30 for a disgusting breakfast typical over priced London i suppose you have better facilities and comfort at a travelodge at over half the price and a damn better breakfast  Nothing
 Stayed for 2 nights on 5 12 6 12 wasn t happy with the room because it s was so hot 28 degree so stuffy and can t breath and we both find it very hard to sleep both night we have lost a lots of sleep We have complained and they did change the room for us but we experienced same thing No internet in 4 stats hotel that s ridicalous The reception staff he was in his senior age but he was very rude and no politeness Now I know why this hotel kept on having promotion because it s quiet Not value of money Wait till Novota hotel finish building this hotel will be quiet as funeral  It s just close by to Canary Wharf 
 Room was dated and very used torn carpets marks on doors etc Additional fee for use of gym if this is onsite why not include in the whole package another cost is off putting to customers Staff seem miserable  Location
 no room heating regulator it was freezing water faucet broken sink had a water backlog friendly staff nice big room nice view great restaurant close to where I needed to go as a women travelling alone I felt safe
 The DLR noise was disturbing at some point Location was really nice Canary Wharf financial district Access to public transport was simple Access to shops eg Tesco 
 The staff should have mentioned that the balcony was shared as you dont expect people to walk past your window when you are on the 11th Floor and your room has all glass windows which were fab The breakfast was very disappointing this needs to be upgraded  Location was very near Canary Wharf Tube Station The room was great on the 11th Floor with spiral staircase 
 I asked for a wake up call at 7am I didn t receive one at all and when I checked out 2 hours later than expected the receptionist simply said oh sorry Thanks you re all checked out That didn t go down well when I was late for work The mattress I slept on may as well have been made from bones with a few springs in the middle singularly the most uncomfortable bed of my existence on this planet The free WiFi was only available in the lobby of the hotel despite being told the hotel offered free WiFi throughout Seen as that was 9 floors below me and I would have to wait for the slowest lift in the world that was non existent  The Breakfast looked delicious however I was unable to have any due to being 2 hours late getting up after my lack of wake up call 
 This place was completely outdated They charge you for every little thing enterance to they gym a towel at the gym Internet etc  It was close to my client
 Unclean spit on hallway carpet bad breakfast don t waste your time waiting for elevator if you leave room 8 00 9 30am take stairs gym cost 4 pounds and 1 extra if you dare ask for a towel and it s only open 7am 10pm apparently not even 10 min early wifi is a nightmare with Bitbuzz who btw won t give you a refund if you device doesn t connect  Only pro close to client office
 Old fittings and smell Particularly the smell of cigarettes coming through the vent in the bathroom guessing from the smoking rooms below Shower didn t work in the morning as water either freezing or boiling so had to have a bath The 4 2 rating calculated by this site is confusing based on my feedback  Location
 Bathroom door lock stuck closed and handle didn t open the door for ages Room 414 Also shower mixer does not work so had really hot shower as couldn t turn it down  Your are so close to Canary Wharf it easy for me to do business and stay over although not when I am late because I got stuck in your bathroom
 The pool facilities you have to pay when it doesn t tell you that when you book or when we went down the member of staff didn t say anything I only found out when I went down again when I wanted to use the facility Found this bad I loved the location of the hotel it was not to far away from central Members of staff very helpful an the fact that we could leave our suitcases was brilliant because we had an evening train back was good 
 The hotel itself is very beautiful however the rooms could do with a slight updating The bed was not very comfortable due to the fact the bed linen was very thin  The staff are friendly and the entrance to the hotel is set out very beautifully It felt like a very calm environment Location is decent as with a few minutes walk Canary Wharf is just around the corner 
 Room tv didn t work properly and concierge uninterested in arranging fix Very scruffy hotel Staff seemed unmotivated probably because the hotel is run down and unloved by manager owner No Positive
 The hotel although generally good is in need of a refurbishment to create a more quality feel to the place There are quite a few scratches on the various wood panels and furniture and the lifts felt a bit creaky  A handy location for the O2 with North Greenwich being 1 stop from Canary Wharf The rooms are comfortable it has a decent bar area and although we didn t have time to explore it did look to have decent leisure and restaurant facilities too 
 The attitude of the staff The smell of cigarettes everywhere The size of the room The price over 400 euros for the smallest room I ever seen The dirty walls in the bathroom Breakfast is very good
 the room was noisy could here the room next door at 1am very old fashioned mold in the bathroom and wall paper ripped Tv is set so far from bed you cannot watch it as it is stuck to the wall In the dining room all the chairs have seen better days for sure Only one lift working out of 3 so stopped on every floor to be able to go ground floor after 10 mns waits at the top good breakfast display and staff at breakfast helpful
 Awful decor bed cleanliness naff Christmas music in public areas no bottled water in room over priced Alan Partridge wouldn t stay here  Close to office 
 Paying for wifi and leisure facilities  Reception staff are incredibly nice and always happy to help Definitely worth the money and a reasonably nice location with public transport only walking distance away 
 The hotel is run down many unrepaired damages provisionally repaired carpet and the Italian restaurant is not recomendable The Indian restaurant is not bad but certainly not super  Location is perfect 5 minutes from Canary wharf tube 
 Hotel reception toilets dirty and unclean No sanitary machines in whole hotel dissapointed at lack of help when needed  Complementary upgrade Good breakfast at reasonable price Nice comfy beds and nice clean comfortable room 
 Quite noisy as above ground train station nearby Bed quite firm Heating we couldn t sort it was very warm in our room but we should have asked one of the members of staff Shower quite old fashioned as you regulated by the hot and cold tap on the bath  Location is close to the o2 and outside centre of London
 There was an overhead rail line litrally outside my bedroom window and was running til early hours and then started again about 6ish the next morning but looked like it affected a few hotels was able to accomodate us last minute concierge was great I am on crutches and every time they saw mw they opened doors for me and made sure I was comfortable 
 The bed was a little hard and as I was checking in one of the staff members looked like a manager shouted at a couple to go by lift instead of taking the stairs which was off putting Loved the room and feel of the hotel staff where friendly except for what looked like The manager shouting T a couple to go up to there room by lift instead of taking the stairs location is good overall a good stay
 They had double booked our reservation so we had to spend time rectifying this so we weren t double charged we were then contacted at 9 30 pm in our room to make payment when we had already paid that day the food was dreadful in Jenny s Restaurant buffet style bland and not good quality Location and reception staff helpful
No Negative We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a room which was absolutely amazing with the most spectacular views across the City we were blown away can t thank them enough 
 Paying for the spa facilities was rather a shock so only used it once staff in the spa area were not as friendly as the hotel staff we were upgraded which was a pleasant surprise staff friendly evening meal in the Italian restaurant was very nice breakfast good but very busy though still lots of food available
 Reception staff unwelcoming Looked like they did not enjoy their job Room was shabby would not have been pleased if I had paid full price Location Value for money
 Hotel very tired dated knocked around furnishing missing and broken noises woke me coming from bathroom at 7 7 30 could feel the dlr trains going past making the hotel shake Wouldn t pay full price for this hotel Location and cost
 Unfortunately the hotel appears to lack the idea of when it first opened as all interior and decor appears to have been left to rot Which has found itself open to work crews and football fans More stag and hen party venue than usual expected client  Suite was beautiful with amazing view Though interior and decor requires an update 
 The beds are terrible the mattresses need replacing springs have gone the showers are not always good pressure or decent flow can be very noisy through the night externally  I love the location and the price is competitive that is why I am a frequent visitor to this hotel 
 Very slow check in Hotel looking tired and poor standard of fittings  Good location for the O2 arena Short walk to Tube and DLR Nice view from the 11th floor 
 The staff were not very welcoming the decor is extremely dated and the breakfast was too expensive for the range that was available  The location is very accessible
 The receptionist was stone faced did not say hello or welcome and a smile would not have gone amiss We had intended to use the Indian restaurant within the hotel but it was freezing in the restaurant so we left and ate out  The location of this hotel is great for Canary Wharf tube station or the DLR The hotel is easily accessible by car It is value for money 
 There was no hot water in the bathroom tap we only stayed the night and told the reception as we left We had to wait to be checked in and out Stayed in this hotel before so knew what to expect It was for our anniversary room was great comfort location buffet breakfast we were able to leave rucksack whilst we went shopping
 Breakfast poor staff unhelpful had to ask for table to be cleared and Lady on duty did not seem happy that I asked her to do it dropped cutlery on floor twice did not sort out fresh coffee pot just walked off Room service good very quick with order and polite and helpful when delivering order front desk staff very professional and efficient
 There could have been a better choice of teas and coffees and of toiletries in the room No biscuits either  The hotel is on the waterside with stunning views The hotel was not pretentious but comfortable with friendly staff The temperature in our room was just right not uncomfortably hot like many hotels 
 Breakfasts were bland Bedroom was cleaned each day but bottles and glasses were not removed over our three days Television did not work Had to report each morning and evening Cash machine out of order  Location and helpful staff
 I regularly book hotels around London on a regular basis for clients In this instance i arrived at the Hotel to pre pay for my client so he could check in when he arrived Unfortunately after being assured that there would be no problems my client arrived and could not check in Further more the guy at the front desk was rude and extremely unhelpful and should definitely not be working in a customer based enviroment Terrible service and would not recommend this Hotel to anyone Please avoid at any cost No Positive
 We had an executive room but the heating was not working An electric heater had been left in the room but this did not work either The room temperature was 15 degrees and there was no towel rail in the bathroom Altogether a disappointing experience No Positive
 Underground car park full of rubbish old carpets and various fittings filthy dirty having paid for overnight parking I had to shift a load out of the way in order to make some space for my vehicle  Decent Indian Meal if somewhat expensive 
 The radiator heater were not functioning My kids slept in a cold room which was quite uncomfortable Something needs to be done with the radiators on the 1st floor especially at this time of the year  Prices are reasonable sometimes 
 Room was old and dirty didn t sleep for 2 nights due to the bed being so uncomfortable Staff were polite and helpful easy access to the tube station
 Hotel a bit jaded Entrance could be better marked Small area for food at breakfast time and long queues Go to breakfast early  Going to Barclays tennis in 02 hotel was I stop on the jubilee line from venue I was checked in at 11am which I really appreciated Receptionist most helpful and professional as were the concierge team Good choice of breakfast
 I thought the bed was very uncomfortable I know it s silly to complain but the mattress was awful to sleep on  Great location for Canary Wharf and hotel had facilities restaurants and bar And pool and gym at an extra cost Overall good place to stay if your looking at Canary Wharf 
 Wi Fi in a hotel room is not an added service to be charged for It s a basic utility like electricity or water This hotel needs to join the 21st century  Staff are friendly and helpful 
 The smell of smoke in the room the unfriendly staff the fact only one elevator worked the fact a double bed was two single beds made separately but pushed together  The pressure of the water and the exit 
 Was given the wrong room and staff couldn t do anything about it Two single beds instead of a double Bathroom smelt bad like a damp smell Staff were not supporting Trip was for a celebration wasn t worth celebrating after getting our room  Lovely exterior and location of the hotel But don t be fooled don t judge s book by its cover 
 In need of modernisation Dim lighting 80s flowery curtains and springy mattress Internet access is charged for  Friendly professional staff Good location for business in canary wharf 
 The room was unwelcoming very cold in look and temperature There was a small electric heater for the room I assume this was because the heating controls were off not working so we spent a very cold Saturday night in the room The room whilst clean was minimalist in its decor which contributed to the cold feel as well  The location was good staff were courteous and helpful Breakfast was very good and again the Restaurant staff were very courteous and helpful 
 The room does not have a window I had a single room on the first floor The room has been recently refurbished with new carpet bathroom and furnishings 
 Not exactly the best value in the world but hey this is London so you gotta take what you can get  Very close to Canary Wharf This is the reason for coming so the location is good 
 The bed the poor quality of fixtures and the lack of apparent knowledge of these things by the staff This hotel is not 4 quality The tap was broken there were metal wires sticking out of the mattress in the middle of the bed and we woke with bites The food in the restaurant Spice was poor quality and very dry Stay away from this hotel 
 Needs a good overhaul Dark in rooms and an exec twin was very very basic and sparse 2 Coffee sachets no mini bar not a biscuit Bedroom windows don t open Breakfast pretty gross Plastic bread for toast and whole jar of jam bunged in a bowl Awful croissants and cold coffee pot on tables like at work Staff extremely helpful and polite Comfy beds
 We had a 45 minute wait for food at the indian restaurant We were told that they were extremely busy but there were only 5 people in the restaurant  The price was the best part of the stay 
 Parking was expensive when you already paid a lot for hotel 21 for 24 hours but then again its London lol Staff was nice hotel was nice breakfast was good a little noisy at night with the DLR but its London lol apart from that we enjoyed our stay there 
 the Ladies staff weren t nice at all The guys were very good especially the Afro British staff they were very nicer and very very helpful  The breakfast was Just nothing but AMAZING lots of things to eat like alot very good for the price
 Waiting for lift after breakfast There was a queue so I took the stairs to the fifth floor instead larger room upgrade 3 beds in the room and overlooked the wharf
 My room was in a poor state and seemed as though it was just drying out after a bathroom flood The room also had a strong musty odour On the evening of my stay I was unable to order food from the restaurant as I was advised the wait would be at least 2 hours After reporting the problems with my room at thge front desk and being told someone would be up to speak to me no one came up to see me No Positive
 Your facilities look run down I had to clean the bath tub because it had hair and I felt disgusted The room also needed dusting I didn t like the duvet either The hotel is in a nice location
 The rooms are quite cold is the only complaint  I loved the size off the room and how clean it was The shower was amazing We really enjoyed ourselves 
 The Location is good and central but there is a train running to close to the building what give a little bit noise Better sound insulation material works  Good money for the value
 Quite dated and our room wasn t avaiable but a decent twin room was offered and a free drink Expensive Parking Pretty standard for London though Good Facilities Great Position on the river
 I have booked an smoker room and I received a non smoker room I had to go down from 11 floor to smoke outside Health services are not open enoughNo Positive
 The only thing I could say is a couple of the bathroom fittings needed to be replaced or repaired for them to work properly  The location was ideal The breakfast was good and there was a swimming pool on location 
 The rooms were a bit tired peeling wallpaper light switches that didn t work a carpet in Jennies which had black tape over the edges seats that were worn It was clean and in a good location and comparable to premier inn
 room was old and tired furniture was old and scruffy power points limited access bathroom very dated lack of facilities e g no fridge in room after all your rate is 4 star staff not knowledgeable did not know what time breakfast was served breakfast staff poor we had to ask for tea table to be cleaned it was dirty bar tariff differed on way out served by a different person on return same drinks cheaper all in all not a place we will hurry back to No Positive
 Couldn t modify the room temperature even though there was a control plaque on the wall Bathroom taps had the tops missing so looked a little dilapidated Second breakfast not so good got toast not croissant as ordered and no confitures with it  Canary Wharf location brilliant Room service food evening lovely Superb bed 
 For a couple there were only two pieces of coffee sugar and tea bags for an overnight stay The most inconvenient was that after having a bath the tub missed the part to release the plug to drain the water that meant we had to leave the dirty water in the tub Obviously it simply made the morning shower impossible It shouldn t have been like that  We appreciated the smoking facility inside the room the view from the heights was beautiful The room was clean bed was tidy and fresh 
 The sound proof of the room is bit weak sometimes can hear noise from next room  location right in the heart of Canary Wharf Extremely easy access to underground and shopping mall 
 Very tired hotel Can t be more than 20 30 years old and looks like it s never had a penny spent on it I have stayed in the Britannia at Manchester and it has a similar tired look this hotel is the same The excuse for Manchester is that the building is over 100 years old The shower in my room was pitiful  Location and size of room 
 beddings noise lights decoration everything was horrible I had booked a single room 5days and had insisted it should be a quiet one I was given the room 441 and my night was a sleepless one from 9pm to 6am Fortunately the next morning i was upgraded to a king size much better and quiet In general the hotel needs a renovation It seems the have not invested since the sixties However the bathrooms are very clean  Front office professional especially their supervisor a bulgarian lady 
 Maybe this hotel has two distinct classes and I was in the below basic Some reviews give it a high mark not sure how This is a VERY tired hotel shabby frayed dim and dingy scuffed worn Staff all look like they dread every minute I got a good deal for this area on this website but after my stay I would have been better booking a B B and taking a risk could not be much worse Breakfast presentation was extremely poor Widows dirty holes in net curtains  Location
 The hotel is in need of redecoration Carpets in corridors are wron Waste bin in hotel room was un emptied Location is good for East London Linen on beds very nice
 The hotel staff tried to pretend that there is no booking through your website until I provided a copy of the booking confirmation I wasn t welcomed well because of the discounted value through booking com The hotel did not care about the daily cleaning of my room Plus the keys were given to me in a stapled paper instead of the well known paper pocket and I considered that as disrespect and disvalue to the guest Finally the staff never smile or give the feeling of welcome to the guest  The location of the hotel and the outside room environment was very clean and the cost was reasonable 
 Staff was quite rude didn t want to help and the room was very basic and stunk of smoke drinks was really overpriced and overall it was a poor stay I would advise to look for other hotels rather than this one  Located easy to get tube and get into central london
 Refused to give us room service Said they were busy and we would have to come down and get it ourselves Hair dryer theirs blew up in my hand and gave me a 3rd degree burn on my wrist and turned it black Concierge staff was very helpful with that Front desk staff with exception of Assistant Manager was just plain rude Carpet is a hazard and the train was extremely loud The place needs to be bulldozed  Location 
No Negative The staff in britannia hotel was amazing They were very kind with us They gave me all the indications to go and visit the city They spoke spanish and even catalan The room was huge with amazing views to the city It was clean and comfortable Very well located the public transport was very close so it was very easy to get to the city centre We really enjoyed our stay in Britannia hotel I recommend it 
 unhelpful staff at reception except the concierge who was very nice when you ask them something you barely get an answer they obviously don t like to work there i found several black hairs and curly hairs in the bat tub i m blonde myself so i jumped out of the bath the moment i noticed them not a good moment for me a shower was also a difficult experience as there is no way with my 5ft10 that i was able to get under the shower as this comes up to my chin the room was freezing cold when i arrived 17 degrees no minibar or at least a big glass for water no free internet and buying a 7 voucher wasnt possible as i kept being thrown out of the tool to buy the voucher breakfast looked like it was there since yesterday at checkout the receptionist tried to make me pay for 3 invoices from other people first if i wouldnt have paid attention i would have spend over 600 for 1 night  for me the only good thing about this hotel is the location but that is because it s in front of my office building nothing more
 The staff was very rude They were not friendly in the welcome they seemed upset when we joined the breakfast last minutr and they appeared to be more friendly only when leaving the hotel Indeed they were the most rude staff I have ever seen in a 4 stars hotel  The hotel was clean and we had a good deal 
 Reception staff are never very friendly Location is great for Canary Wharf I booked a single room but was upgraded to a triple which as happened before Good gym swimming pool which is not over utilised
 Bed mattress was very hard lumpy due to the springs coming through and old Bathroom could have been cleaner also appears very tired soap holder was coming off the wall Only had one bath towel between us but 3 hand towels  Communal areas well decorated Food was tasty 
 No atmosphere maybe due to the time of the year Bars restaurants were empty No free wifi in bedrooms Cost 7 per 24 hours  Great location for the price 
 The Hotel was old and Dirty and my colleague cancelled his other 2 nights if it had not been as late we would have found somewhere else for Monday as wellNo Positive
 In my room I found a sanitary towel bag used for disposal of period towels etc with blood on it The manager at the time came and agreed that it was blood I wasn t offered any compensation at all for what had happened the side was simply wiped off I have photographic evidence of the item  Location
 Chaotic buffet breakfast  When checking in at 7pm to be told that you do not have double bed room as booked was disappointing The receptionist did her best to put right the inconvenience caused I like I had a spacious room and was given complimentary breakfast due to overbooking 
 The staircase in the room it was like I stepped into a hotel in the 60s wasn t what I expected at all The car park was terrible needs a lot of work We only stayed for an overnight the room was really big
No Negative Good location for a base for transport into London and o2 we went on just a basic deal for the weekend and got good value for money for the price we payed would use this hotel again
 Getting to the hotel was a bit of let down after coming off the footbridge and walking along the river then I had to walk all the way around to the front entrance Didn t realise I was supposed to walk with toothpaste as there wasn t any in our room Housekeeping kept disturbing us in the morning when all we wanted was a lie in as check out was at 12 00  Friendly staff
 I found it disgraceful that you can book a double room for 80 and have two single beds pushed together Absolutely farcical  Size of the room 528 and the view 
 Broken tap in the bathroom made showering difficult at first Towels impracticably tiny and I m average size Room key stopped working had to go back to reception twice before I could go to bed on Friday night Breakfast not good food was cold eggs tasteless and watery  Room was lovely and big Bed comfortable View was as expected particularly nice at sunset see pic 
 but it was very tired and could do with a decorative overhaul There was enough room for a kingsize bed which would have been nice but it was very comfortable all the same room had lovely aspect and lots of space
 Shampoo soap and towels provided for one person when the booking was for double occupancy Was asked to go to bar to pay for drinks before we could be served which we found very strange and embarassing especially in fornt of two guests we had The waitress was not firendly or helpfull and she kept repeating that this is the policy in a very unprofessional and non caring attitute No Positive
 Upgraded to twin which actually had a 5ft double bed split into two narrow and hard single beds uncomfortable night  My fourth stay so can t be too bad Useful for access to Canary Wharf or Jubilee line e g London Bridge Allowed me to join an early breakfast party as I needed to depart early 
 Charged for swimming pool room was pretty grubby and certainly needed redecorating incoming calls are charged at a premium rate shower was scalding hot and could not adjust temperature  Not a lot really
 Very noisy with the building works across the road and trains passing by Beds could do with an upgrade Shower very hot or freezing cold  Great staff lovely rooms we were kindly upgraded to a suite 
 A young woman working at reception was very Unreceptive She was cold never smiled even when we were being warm hearted and just didn t seem to care for our presence This caused low score for the staff The twin room we stay in was so loud as there is a huge train station right next to the hotel which rattles through the windows when one pulls in This caused low score for location The windows to the river were incredibly grubby in the restaurant too which brought the mood down  Great quality room plush carpet and spacious Great breakfast too 
 It was a very tired hotel people seeing it for the first time would think it is nice but the standards have slipped it really needs up grading 22 years ago it was on par with the Grand Hotel in Brighton We liked the location as we were using it as a stop over we had been there before 22 years ago
 Stuff was unfriendly not helpful whatsover Needed to ask for late check out three times and every time the answer was misleading very confusing  Localisation is really great but there the good stuff ends 
 My room was on the 2nd floor with no view whatsoever only a wall The second room had no view and no jacuzzi bathtub either Breakfast was average full English breakfast some cereals and fruits yogurt etc Coffee is instant juice feels like being made out of syrup no herbal tea The discount is not really real in the sense that it feels like it s only valid for the hotel s not renovated rooms  I like the location and the overall old style of the hotel I also liked my jacuzzi bathtub 
 Very overpriced for a hotel badly in need of a refit Mould in the shower Wallpaper peeling of the walls TV not tuned poor air conditioning and NO FREE WIFI its 2015  Good gym 
 Nothing We found the hotel easy to find and was clean untidy staff were friendly the room was a nice size and the bed comfortable breakfast was reasonable with a good choice from the buffet 
 I was upgraded to superior room without any window Beds were like for a camp not for a hotel near the heart of Canary Wharf  Great location 
 The facilities are tired and begging for Renovation The Novotel coming up opposite the hotel will take away a greater number of her Customers  The location is great 
 Slow lifts or not working have to pay for Wifi no mixer taps in showers executive rooms no real work station no lamps 1 power point seems popular with tour groups feeding the 5000 in the morning Location
 Receptionists looked unhappy and were not friendly but they were efficient Rooms need updating as they were shabby and out of date furniture  The relaxed atmosphere in the lounge area and the view of Canary Wharf were a delight 
 The buffet breakfast was at best organised chaos no instruction from staff people pushing in grabbing what they want I ve had better breakfast s at 25 B b s  Good location friendly staff nice room although for the money the bathroom was basic and water dripped over the toilet 
 No bad experiences all good  Everything perfect for me great staff superb breakfast and nice location The location is ideal for the O2 Arena 5 min walk to tube station and 2 min by tube from Canary Wharf to North Greenwich Area the hotel is situated in appeared safe to walk round at all hours 10 min walk aware there is a cheap Tesco Express and Subway sandwich bar Hotel easy to find exit tube station turn left walk through big glass building cross foot bridge and youll see it to your right
 The shower facilities in the room was the worst I had ever seen for a hotel of this standard We could not shower properly water hot and cold and tatty fixings The hotel rooms need a complete refurb  Lovely location for O2 and the rest of London staff very friendly 
 My reason for travelling was to attend an event in the O2 When booking I searched for hotels close to the O2 While I could see the O2 from the hotel it took a 20 minute taxi ride to get there due to its location This was a cost of 20 pounds each way No Positive
 We felt the hotel could do with a refresh here and there eg wallpaper in the room scraped marks on the wall in the restaurant Very comfortable room and a lovely cooked breakfast
 Very shabby old worn dirty carpets and furniture cheap bed and sheets marked walls hotel generally looks uncared for Poor value for money obvious lack of upkeep probably as they know they will get customers because of location Would not stay again  Not much
 Very noisy didnt sleep for the first night due to the sound of the railway every 5 minutes and the bed was the most uncomfortable bed ever slept on Overly priced for the both the room breakfast and parking Also free 20mins wifi in lobby area only is pretty disgusting in this age Will not stay again The views was a building site across the dockland water and 10 pounds for a breakfast of croissant cereal and fruit is neither beautiful nor delicious Try Carluccios in the docklands 10 min walk for a far superior breakfast with nice surroundings for less than the hotels breakfast excellent location for O2 arena and the docklands complex
 The bed was two very small beds joined together My 2nd floor room had rooftop as a view Bathroom wall paper were ripped and needed changing Shower in tub didn t have proper screen water splashed on the floor  Arrived in the country very early from Australia Got to the hotel at 0830am and they allowed me to check in at no extra cost Within 5 minutes walking distance from Canary Wharf tube station via the walking bridge The tube is surrounded by huge shopping malls with groceries and restaurants Later check out was allowed for a reasonable charge per hour Restaurant was reasonable for breakfast 
 hotel was ok room was small but was fine for what we wanted Staff were ok but didn t make you feel very welcome and seemed more business orientated than leisure Never told us about breakfast if we wanted it never told us about the leisure centre never asked if we needed help with anything Also we booked a double bed which we got but 2 single mattresses side by side  location was good close to Canary Wharf Tube station and DLR which made everywhere easy to get to 
 Breakfast wasn t as slick as would have liked but they were catering for a lot of people Upgraded us to a superior room which had amazing views across London and to the O2 Car park reasonable tarif Easy to get to river boat taxi
 very noisy room clearly not originally a bedroom space converted from other use badly industrial strength extract no windows Inedible BreakfastNo Positive
 The gym needs better ventilation The staff need to pick up plates and not leave them piled outside the door The decor is so old and dusty revamp it as a Novotel is being built opposite and they will surely take most of your clients soon  The night service guy is super cool
 At arrival the receptionnist told us that they had no more double rooms only twins and that we only managed to book a double because of booking com not being updated 2mins later 2 other couples arrived to checking and also had the same The fan kept running all night and did not let us sleep we complained and were told that they would stop it but they did not Internet is paid and staff is horribly unpleasantNo Positive
 The hot room gave me a very sore throat not happy about that didn t tell me I had to pay for the whole of my 5 day stay on arrival and was locked out my room untill I paid with no warning after I finished a hard days work No wifi connection which was free I liked my parcel I order got taken to my room when I requested for the fan it was In my room when I got back
 The room was dirty and so was the bathroom There was dust everywhere even in the bathroom Thankfully we only stayed 1night Everything was on the dirty side Booked with breakfast and was told to pay extra for the children whilst they were mentioned during the booking The bed was a small double bed At 4am someone above our room decided it was a good time to start swearing and hitting his girlfriend Kids woke up and were very disturbed and frightened I called reception and issue was sorted but at 7am he kicked off again So if you are reading this thanks allot I was more then happy when we checked out Personally I would not go back again to that hotel  The location was superb Just near the dlr and the Jubilie Line Staff dressed up for Halloween 
 My sister and I felt the staff on duty in the restaurant at breakfast could have been a bit more cheerful helpful although very polite didn t really interact  Hotel reception staff were very helpful and friendly Room was very clean and comfortable although just a little tired looking 
 If was not clean at all bathroom lock was broken ripped carpet in bedroom smell throughout pool was awful reminded me of the terrible pools at school was not given a smoking room as requested 21 overnight parking Heating did not work staff spoke little english worst stay everNo Positive
 Breakfast was ok not spectacular  Paid for an inside room but had a window when we got to the room which was a nice bonus Bed was more comfortable than it first appeared Everything was in good order 
 The A C didn t work and the shower head didn t work It was too hot on the room and we got four free drinks as an excuse because they could not give as another room When we tried to use the drink cards we got the bartender said the cards is not allowed No Positive
 our room 1142 was a little tired and dated No Sockets by the bed for alarm or a phone No corkscrew Or ice bucket when we rang reception for one it would ve taken 20 minutes so we decided not to bother  We like the location of the hotel the lobby and lifts were very clean The staff at reception were very friendly and informative 
 I had been appointed a room that the air conditioning didnt turn off i had to call down to reception 3 times before i got an appropriate answer by which time it was gone midnight and too late to change room It was sorted out the next day and i was moved to a room over looking the river which had a thermostat and air conditioning controller in  very local to where i needed to be 
 The following week it was way overpriced 750 for 3 nights definitely not worth that kind of money I had a good deal at 94 per night and well worth this
 Very dated decor Doesnt look like has been decorated for many years Television in my room didn t work maintenance had gone home so were unable to repair or replace Was offered another room but I was already unpacked No reduction on rate offered  Very convenient for Canary Wharf Bar was reasonably priced 
 Like all britannia hotels this one needs some refurbishment Why do they never wash there windows Charging to use hotel facilities e g swimming pool parking Very uncomfortable beds but I suppose they were the most reasonably priced in the area Location was good 
No Negative Nothing was too much trouble The staff were pleasant helpful From helping with parking to requesting a room with good view Was given upgrade at no additional cost to one that far exceeded our expectations Would book again Thank you
 Opening times for breakfast dinner Room had no windows but for 95 night can t complain  Location for what we wanted was great Price was great Pool was great well not great but just greatful to have one even though was 6 for 1 x adult 1 x child Didn t eat there as restaurant opened too late for us as we were going out only pizza place was open so went elsewhere And breakfast wasn t served till 8 30 on Saturday morning again too late for my son I as we had to leave earlier Concierge was great sorted out taxi perfectly 
No Negative My 2nd visit to this hotel room clean and tidy everything we needed staff friendly when checked in location fantastic one stop on tube to the O2 where we were visiting also lots of bars restaurants close by I would stay there again 
No Negative My second time staying here both times have been because I have been going to a concert at the O2 this is a great location for the tube at canary wharf close to the shopping centre and bars one of the very few hotels with on site parking The staff are excellent and very courteous Also very reasonably priced for where it is 
 This is tired old hotel Has not seen investment in its facilities for decades Threadbare beat up furniture hard as nails bed The lifts Ask for lower floor and take the stairs Greasy spoon breakfast It s a rough and ready hotel and as long as you go there not expecting much it ll be fine for a trip to the o2 but it s a long way from its former glory No Positive
 The hotel needs updating and modernising and we felt the hotel was far too hot heating was on full blast throughout and the room didn t cool down even with the fan on  Location of the hotel was perfect for our needs and very close assess to the O2 arena and the breakfast was brilliant 
 A pity to see out on the tables in the restaurant very old sugar containers that are somewhat out dated  The double bed was extremely comfy a good position for the 02 
 Furnishings tired and not attended to for years Room stank and carpets stained Try to extract money for standard things like wifi gym and pool  Location good Gym ok 
 This hotel has seen better days 25 years ago Nonsmoking room smelled like smoke Asked to change rooms cancelled the request but changes rooms anyway while we were out to a smoking room Moved into another nonsmoking room but each day I had to get a new room key The food was very low quality I wouldn t want to step in much less eat it Too many rules and charges  It was close to O2 
 The room was disgustingly dirty The bathroom was appalling the wall tiles where covers in soap scum from previous ocupants The wall paper was hanging of the walls the room smelled of damp The window was bolted shut and every window in the hotel was dirty The whole place needs a good clean  We liked the location 
 Hotel very shabby and dated Noise from trains until late was unbearable Drinks very expensive for the standard of hotel Tea and coffee at breakfast was not very good at all Beds were tiny and not very comfortable  Staff were pleasant breakfast was reasonable 
 The pool area is not as clean as it looks on the pictures It is quite misleading The steam room door is a hazard Not happy sauna was out of use and still being charged full price to use facilities And hotel is very very dusty needs touching up give it a fresh look  Breakfast was ok decor was also acceptable 
 Queue for breakfast was very long There were at least 20 people waiting in line for both days we stayed Set up location for breakfast can definitely be improved One lady was incredibly crumpy at the reception She obviously didn t have her day which was a pity as in general the staffs were helpful and friendly except her  Price and Location though it was a challenge to find the hotel at night You just need to know how to best reach the hotel via a small bridge which took only 5 10mins from the metro Room was very comfortable and spacious Nearby restaurants pubs shopping malls Great location 
 While the room furniture and decor is a little dated it didn t tarnish our stay  Everything was clean and worked Don t know what reviewers who complained about the rooms were expecting for an affordable hotel in London 
 It would be great to have a pen in room  Great location for visiting O2 Arena Staff was kind Beautiful continental breakfast despite of first impression that there is nothing on tray Big bath 
 The bed was very uncomfortable it was 2 single beds joined and one half was slightly higher than the other one and the mattress was hard It was a very noisy in the room it was the outside noise  The staff were very polite and the accommodation staff were very helpful 
 The tube and DLR at midnight and quarter to seven in the morning but hey it s London Don t rely on your mobile phone GPS as a pedestrian it loses the signal too frequently to be relied on something to do with the tall buildings all around you apparently  I appreciate the fact that I went on a deal but my room was comfortable warm and had all the facilities I could want on my short stay For the things I wanted to do it was well located 
 Rooms were slightly old fashioned and the price of water and drinks at the bar were extremely expensive Shouldn t have had to pay for the pool considering we already payed for the hotel  Pool and Spa were nice Loved the lobby and the tea and coffee facilities Staff were quite accommodating 
 Not a 4star hotel inedible breakfast grumpy staff but could nt blame them really Furniture windows carpets all falling apart Location great for 02 but a lot of money to pay for this place  Location
No Negative Absolutely nothing The staff was unfriendly I ve never slept on a bed made of stones but I think what I experienced sleeping on their bed got pretty close Hotel customers have to pay to get access to internet Nothing can be borrowed gratuitously from the hotel The room service food was disgusting I highly advice future customers to refrain from ordering anything 
 Getting the rooms assigned was a little tricky and for some reason the hotel was kept very warm temperature in the room was 23degC The location with Access to Canary Warf and very close proximity to DLR and Underground
 That my hair brush still cannot be located  Location of my bedroom window as I requested Whew Size style of my bed bedroom and all it contained The decoration and cleanliness of the bathroom Easy access to underground and other places 
 The member of staff that I checked in with was extremely curt Looked at me as though I was below him Very unwelcoming for a hotel of that standard I asked for water to be sent to my room to which I was told I would have to pay 5 for the tray That is ridiculous I have never heard such rubbish in my life I have paid for not just a room but a service and to have to pay extra is ridiculous I have never had to do that in any other hotel I have stayed in That needs to be changed Finally you should change your policy on wifi I cannot believe hotels in London charge for wifi when most hotels in Europe it is free You should again review this Terrible I am extremely disappointed with the hotel and would have expected a lot more  The room was large
 The worst hotel I have ever stayed in UK The staff in unpolite the service is not a 4 star at all The final amount of my bill was deducted twice from my account it took two weeks to get back my money Without saying any sorry to me Do not go to this hotel No value no service for your money at all  I can not list any positive for this hotel 
 Tired old and dark decor Lobby was filled with gaudy bronze statues and tired carpet Given the area the hotel is located Canary Wharf it doesn t echo its surroundings When the modern Novotel opens across the road they will need to modernise the rooms here quickly Additionally I left my luggage with concierge after I checked out and upon returning they had been mixed up with other guests Luckily everything was located in the end however this suggests a lack of organisation and commitment to great service Finally before we left the hotel there was an incident in the lobby area where water poured through the ceiling alongside light fittings Other guests notified the staff of this however the staff were not at all concerned or fazed by the imminent safety risks posed by water and electricity mixing The area was half heartedly cordoned off buckets placed to catch the water in the wrong spots and then everyone went back to work No sense of urgency or surprise regarding this Maintainence issue  Good sized room received complimentary upgrade 
 Rooms very hot air con noisy and ineffective but staff did arrange for a window to be opened Great location brilliant value for money lovely breakfast
 The hotel is a bit shabby needed to be smartened up The lift service is dreadful only two lifts for 600 people Bad toilet service for the bar area  Excellent location lots of hot water 
 Tired slightly smelly hotel that is well past it s best phones didn t work windows didn t open air con didn t work hot and airless bed was old and uncomfortable plug socket had black burn marks no tea bags and with all this they still wouldn t offer wifi without additional payment Worst hotel we have ever stayed at very bad value at 140 Nothing Would never go to any hotel in this chain ever again 
 Staff are rude lifts take ages Hotel is dated needs refurbishing Smoking rooms are next door to non smoking rooms the smell was awful Room service plates were left in the hallways Bathroom had damp and paint peeling away on walls Fixtures were badly filled Carpet was freyed all around hedges Paid for double 2 beds pushed together that wouldn t stay together Windows are filthy Cleanliness was not to high standard so did not eat in hotel due to this The location is brilliant hotel looks lovely from outside amazing views and jacuzzi bath was a nice surprise
No Negative This place gets a poor rep but it is great value 200 for two nights in London in a great location and a hotel with a slap up breakfast and leisure club which is only 8 extra for two can t beat that 
 when we were checking out they initially were not able to put our luggage in the cloakroom because they said it was full  The room was big enough since we were 3 in one bedroom 
 Breakfast was average Front desk was not very helpful on checkout When we asked to leave our bags they said their cloakroom was full They made no effort to help I had to insist before they made any effort  Location was fairly good Rooms were clean comfortable and spacious 
 Staff was not very friendly decoration was old beds were not very comfortable breakfast was not good at all coffee was horrible and the rest was poor quality  Reasonable price good location 
 Carpet on the ground not hygienic Air conditioned heater wasn t working properly The room was really really hot Window frame was not fastened properly you could see signs of previous attempts to fix it so not completely closed Breakfast Location half hour by underground from city s hearth Nice furnitures Pleasant view of the canal from the dining room
 High level hotel and not even a bottle of water in the room Carpet moquette on the ground is really not hygienic Good quality of the room it self
 On arrival we were told there were no non smoking double rooms left After waiting 50 minutes we were then told that they found one No heating in the room after 2 phone calls to reception and a wait of 1 hour portable radiator delivered to room at 1 00 am Two hone calls to room at 05 30 am and 05 40 am for a pizza delivery which we had not ordered Overall very dissatisfied with the whole experience and on informing the hotel manager about this we were very flippantly told nothing could be done about it as it was Sunday and the Management team were not available  Location
 Not clean needs refurbishment No slippers I could not use a hairdryer normally it was kept in a drawer linked to the wall behind the chest Its cable went out for only 20 30 cm from the box so I had to dry my hair sitting on my knees near the chest Not a very pleasant stay  Location close to major Canary Warf buildings
 20 mins of free Internet in such a developed country is a shame Poor breakfast plastic apples Dirty carpet no slippers offered Plug adapters for GBP5No Positive
 Staff at reception were painfully slow and didn t seem to know what they were doing Whilst this hotel is certainly run down and needs a good facelift it is great value for money and has everything you need in a great location Clean and comfortable
 Allocate a room next to railway line unable to sleep Moved rooms approx 12 45am Next room so cold heating not working Vomit in the lift Terrible night and had to attend an interview early morning  Nothing 
 A lot of things For instance aircondition noisy and totally ineffective furniture worn out towels children size service lousy and you are charged for everything Staying in hotels more than 30 nights a year I have experienced one with a poorer relationship between price and quality No Positive
No Negative Got an upgrade when we booked in Very good value for money staff could be more polite as when leaving we handed in keys and never got a thank u how s ur stay been bye apart from that was excellent
 Room cleanliness Flys are present in room and present on towel There was annoying noice we can t sleep through the night due to water driping in toilet and scary flys plush DLR Please check the photo and very cool concierge manager who says I know fly came from bathroom air went If he knows why do they sale this types of rooms  Reception staff and publick area nice and clean good location
 The bedroom was disgusting and dirty and smelt stale like a working mans club The breakfast was very poor too It is in serious need of a shake up it s very tired It s close to Excel
 Got a room without window and it was very difficult When we approached the staff they did not oblige to change the room Gym and other facilities should be open from 6 AM till at least 11 PM  Location of as good with the backdrop of waterbody 
 Said WiFi wasfree in lobby true BUT you have to sign back on to it every 30 minutes which is most inconvenient No instructions as to how to sign in  Clean quiet good staff 
 If the Night staff worked for me I would either re train them or change them they are the most un helpful people I ve met Complete change from the day staff Also found the rooms a little smelly like going into a care home Rooms were a little tired and could do with a re vamp  Reception night staff very unhelpful and a little arrogant but day staff very helpful
 Very very old hotel Two very small lifts and there is always a queue Not so great quality breakfast Same spread everyday Staff is bored and couldn t be bothered much about a customer We travelled with a baby were refused to have a milk bottle warmed up in any of their microwaves  Location of the hotel It s in Canary Wharf 
 Location too far from tourist attractions but we were not familiar with public transportation and spent a lot on taxis But it was worth it for our first visit to London No Positive
 My upgrade to a bigger room had 3 single portable beds all with remarkably uncomfortable mattresses Breakfast was appalling the cheapest of ingredients and served tepid Staff in bar rudely challenged me carrying 2 pints 10 yards from the counter to my table until I produced my room ID never experienced anything like it  Location good Spacious bar with nice view 
 Hotel is tired and desperately in need of full refurbishment used to be a premium hotel that is falling behind the time and competition  Location good just a few minutes walk from DLR and Tube 
 This was the worst hotel I stayed since my student days The room was tiny but more importantly in a terrible condition The bedding smelled and I had spread my clothes over the bed to be able to sleep The walls were covered with marks the carpet dirty It took me nearly half an hour to check in even though there was only one or two people ahead of me There is no way this is a 4 star hotel I would seriously question whether it would be classified as a 3 star either Very disappointing No Positive
 400GBP full price and we got it for 120 this can t be true The whole experience seemed like it should be a 90 a night type of place The GYM Pool needs to close down Seriously it s in a bad way Horrible to be in Staff were very rude and didn t seem to enjoy being there Breakfast was I hate to say dreadful it was honestly like something out of Ramsay s kitchen nightmares Chips were on the buffet at breakfast Booking com said this room was valued at It was a shocker I m afraid Britannia  The balcony and the room itself was actually OK but not worth the full price rate 
 Room service poor quality waiter not willing to help the answer No doesn t seem to be an issue food not great pappardelle was ok but pizza disgusting Also on check out I was asked what s my problem instead of what do I need I asked him why does it need to be a problem I am just standing at the reception Just wanted to check out Not fully understood the issue there  Easy check in procedure Nice friendly staff on check in Room well equipped
 It s a bit tired the bar was partially closed and looked like it was part way through a refurb that was being done very slowly  Great Location good breakfast large room exec comfy bed nice view of the docks
 A bit old fashioned and very over priced Room looked out over the roof of a garage  Location was ok for the tube but nothing to do or nowhere to go locally 
 The hotels inability to manage the booking and allow third party card authorisation is woeful In addition to this I have waited a week for the card pre authorisation to be cancelled A farcicle process very poor communication and a lack of care about resolving customer issues  The location
No Negative Comfort of room and cleanliness Asked to change room as my husband had hurt his leg this was dealt with quickly and with the minimum of fuss although all staff were busy 
 The double bed was too small and the cooked breakfast was a bit of a disappointment  Location was great just 15 mins from central London on tube just a 10 min walk to Canary Wharf tube station Staff very helpful and efficient got us checked in very quickly and recommended a good restaurant with easy walking distance 
 Male night desk clerk was overtly rude Distance to Underground despite what was advertised was a LONG way to walk Hotel and room decorating were absolutely laughable Soap dish in bathtub was positioned to slice the bather s leg open  Concierge was very good That s the only complement I can manage for this property 
 The room was very basic for the amount paid 300 per night It was very noisy the window of my room would not shut so all I heard until the early hours of the morning and then again at about 5 a m was the DLT Trains The room was also very warm the air con didn t work Finally the mattress on the bed was so thin I might as well have slept on the floor How they can justify 300 per night beggars belief  Location to my place of work
 rooms at rear of hotel prone to noise from outside some lights were out and the expelair in bathroom wasn t working or wasn t there  Was upgraded from a room without window to a room with one value for money and great transport links
 Was not really made clear that breakfast would be cheaper if we d booked it on the day and not willing to pay 13 50 each on the morning Allowed in to our room early which was very good for us as we d travelled all night to London and we had a smoking room that was available
No Negative It s a fabulous location Close to lots of modern fashionable places to eat My room was on a budget price and the decoration a little tired The room was very clean and had all the usual ensuing facilites 
 This is the first time to complain and it s a real shame but BED BUGS Come on you can do better than this I have 5 ugly bug bites the day after staying Also the room was very hot and the fan did not work very stuffy and hard to sleep in 325 A staff member bought me a fan which I was appreciative of but was still too stuffy Your lifts are also very slow  The hotel is great stayed many times now Sadly on my last visit I have found some things that need addressing 
 Overall this hotel is very tired and in need of refurbishment Bedroom bathroom facilities are meagre and basic for a hotel of this stature Restaurant reflects the same feeling that this hotel is no more than a very large cheap bed breakfast  Proximity to Canary Wharf and City of London
 Entire hotel needs a facelift very dated Service was not consistent Guests had to pay to use gym facilities Not sure why this has 4 stars  Good location if in canary wharf 
 Check in was slow Staff were ignorant with poor English making us wait as it was handover After a 4 hour drive at 11pm it wasn t fun Room was very dated There was a metal spiral staircase which creaked throughout the night causing a bad sleep  Location handy for the DLR Tube 
 After getting into our room 809 and finding bedlinen smelt disgusting took the night staff who are very unfriendly and struggle to speak English over an hour to come up with the solution of switching rooms at 11pm at night we didn t even stay for breakfast we had paid for I must also state not once did anyone appologise for the inconvenience or the state of the linen  Early check in was fantastic location awesome reception day staff great
 the plug socket was hanging off the wall so not safe The airconditioning was so loud a piece of cardboard was stuck with ducktape around the vent on the ceiling When asked how to turn it off was told not possible although did go quieter at 11pm totally unacceptable Very clean modern room
 The hotel inside looked tired The staff on in the morning not very welcoming  The location was great Very relaxing hotel overlooking the river About a 5minute walk to Canada square which is full of great places to eat 
 The bedroom furniture was chipped and grubby looking Went to have a shower and the tap disintegrated into bits I went and complained and got a room upgrade so ended up ok  Breakfast was good busy but food was nice 
 A room without a window thus more a box on a noisy corridor with noisy airconditioning system and a horrible white light fixture Is it too much trouble for the reception staff to address their customers rather than mumbling instructions credit card sign here And all of the above for 190 pounds night  The only likable thing about this hotel is that it is in Canary Warf which is good if you have to be in that area 
 The bed was very small and very uncomfortable The breakfast was not great and we had to wait for eggs on the first morning they never arrived  Nice and central to Canary Wharf
 Price didn t include breakfast and pre booked breakfast would cost 10 for a buffet London prices I guess Hotel was nicely presented Clean and orderly
 WiFi is not free as it was advertised For 250 a night free WiFi should not be a problem Bathroom is old and small  Location is good for Canary Wharf 
 The Sunday night prices used to be considerably lower but have now increased to a level that one can look at the option of staying in central London good quality B B  Location and friendliness of the staff
 thought my room although clean and spacious was Dated reminded me of my mums front room in the late 80s Brown and dull no communication of reception staff on leaving hotel when checking out as in thankyou for staying at our hotel hope you had a nice stay have a save journey nothing which is probaly nothing to the average joe but its the last memory of the stay And if they want customers to come back theyed strengthen there chances by making there customers feel like they were there in the first place  the choice of eateries within the hotel were good and fairly priced the over all communial spaces within the hotel were good 
 Uncomfortable beds and be careful with the taps in shower especially on high floors very hot water and could scald if not careful  Location location location great value and Canary Wharf is a great place and very handy to ExCel and O2 
 Staff in restaurant were rushed off their feet so didn t have time to answer any queries and therefore came across quite rude The restaurant was dirty with the windows in a desperate state The bedroom was in a poor condition and in urgently ineed of refurbishment The carpet had sections cut out and crudely replaced with other sections of carpet so no pattern matched and frayed edges No Positive
 Only thing was the noise from the dlr and birds in the morning I was surprised how much noise was through the windows maybe just our room but apart from that amazing stay Amazing staff beautiful place everyone really kind and helpful in a non fake way really great night restaurant open late lovely food staff really try make your stay the best they can loved that really friendly 
 Staff themselves fine but sometimes seem a little swamped reception check in system seems very convoluted and slow Very large parties of tourists can mean queues quickly build up at breakfast or front desk  Room clean and decent size worth paying a little more for a bigger one Value OK if you get a typical 50 off deal Location OK for Canary Wharf if that suits you Breakfast fine 
 Room did not have a Window And i booked a normal standard room completely unacceptable Bathroom looked like a hospital toilet not a hotel room Breakfast was tasteless and not fresh Bread was even still a bit frozen Mushrooms probably from cans no fresh juices Also restaurant Windows were extremely dirty they looked like they havent been cleaned for months No Positive
 Staff not very Knowledgeable didn t know best way to get to O2 Disappointed to be charged for another hours parking when we were 15mins late getting back L Very good location easy access to Hotel and into London Rooms clean and comfortable 
 Breakfast options poor considering price Insufficient servings available at buffet bar considering number of guests  Excellent location Comfortable surroundings Bedroom spacious clean comfy bed 
 I felt I was misled by having to pay for parking The room was very basic and cold The breakfast was very average for the price The car park was not very well lit and had rubbish everywhere  I liked the decor and grandeur of the communal area the bar and lounge were good The reception staff were not very welcoming and didn t even say hello upon arrival The concierge and taxi driver were very pleasant and helpful 
 It took an age to get checked in as the assistant s printer wouldn t work There was no apology for keeping us waiting The bathroom wasn t all that clean There were also some very dubious looking women hanging around the hotel It gave the impression of being a convenient place to take someone picked up I wouldn t want to stay there alone as a woman  Large bed and location for visiting the city 
 Mattress was worn out with springs poorly covered Decor looking rather tired Bathroom fittings from 1980s Noise from Docklands Light Railway  Given room on 11 12th floor large room with great view and quirky spiral staircase up from entrance 
 We had a mezzanine room with a staircase and a door at the lower level to another room I assume to create a suite if it were required I woke in the middle of the night thinking that someone was in our room They were not they were in the room below The soundproofing between the two was that bad I am not a light sleeper  View from the room that we were given was great 
No Negative Even after we checked out we were allowed to leave our case while we attended to our business and use the health club facilities later in the day for the same rate as residents 
 The rooms were not very clean at least how I expected they charged me double per a room and it showed lack of organisation  The location was great convenient for going to Central London 
 It was dirty run down over priced poor location some of the staff were friendly and some of them acted like they didn t even want to be there I wouldn t stay again it was offered to me for free  Nothing
 Your staff s attitude at reception Told to go to tesco for food due to technical fault in kitchen and no food available Refused a refund and option to checkout and left without food in hotel Your underground car park is a shambles and had to kick a rat away when parking The noise from the train outside is terrible and can be improved with proper windows The position of the tv on the wall is stupid from when you are in bed too  Nothing 
 There is NO 4 star hotel Everything is old and destroyed No fridge in the room The cue to get a brakefast takes 30 min Just like the warming up time of energy saving bulbs in the room awfullNo Positive
 Car park was narrow and looked uncared for Dents in the walls from previous visitors staff moving tables Noise from the DLR was fairly prominent Lack of standard plug sockets near tables desks Nice and easy check in Clean public areas Polite staff Easy to find hotel
 Rear rooms facing the O2 are noisy from very early morning get due to the Heron Quay Line passing very close  Decor and furniture dated but room large and clean Ideal location for O2 and Canary Wharf Would definitely stay again 
 There s hardly anything to complain about however must say it does get quite warm in the room so we had to have the fan on most of the time a little noisy but you get used to it also not as many plug sockets available in the room  I was very lucky to have been upgraded to an executive lounge as it was my birthday I absolutely love the interior very suave The bed was indeed comfortable and all room facilities of good use I think the bathroom was my favourite with the huge mirrors and marble surfacing Staff were always willing to help and answer any queries Thank you 
 Room was pretty basic considering we paid over 160 for it and that was a discounted price  Lovely location and views staff foreign so sometimes hard to understand what they were saying 
 The breakfast was just OK The Evening Meal was reasonable but nothing to write home about Only one plastic bitter on offer at the bar  The decor ambience and position are excellent The staff were pleasant but difficult to converse with 
 We found that the staff who dealt with our check and the breakfast staff were unwelcoming rude and incompetent Breakfast was a shambles with large pot of coffee and tea left on all the tables for the whole morning for all guests no fresh tea or coffee the table was not cleaned and the breakfast bar looked unappetising We walked out of breakfast and went elsewhere Although it says there is a choice of restaurants only one was open in the evening We met a couple who had been given a room that was already occupied and with a key that let them into the room  Leaving 
 The staff knocking on the door so often when there is a do not disturb sign up and walking in while I m in bath Everything was so beautifully put together at this hotel 
 First impression of the room was quite nice although you don t have to look hard to see that the d cor is looking a little tired You only get 20 mins free Wi Fi that s pathetic really compared with other hotels I could get more than that at my railway station Worst of all was the experience at breakfast the staff were unwelcoming and apparently unwilling to communicate beyond mumbled replies you couldn t hear The queues were long and slow and down a central aisle next to guests trying to eat their breakfast all the food was around one central service area so whether you wanted hot food cereal or fruit you all joined the same queue so unless you wanted to cut in later you had to get everything together and hope you made it back to your table with everything still in bowls or on plates A lucky few seemed to get hot drinks brought to them others were left to work it out for themselves I m glad I only stayed one night the thought of having to endure another breakfast debacle would have been too much I ve had better experiences at Holiday Inn  The reception and lounge areas were very pleasant
 Rude and poorly trained staff they have no customer service skills No water in the room I asked for water at reception and I was told I had to buy it from the bar for over 2 Had to queue for 20 minutes to get to the bar No staff around to offer any help Everything is an extra charge including advertised facilities and Wifi Cheap to stay at but I would pay more to stay anywhere else  Close to central Canary Wharf Rooms basic but clean 
 A little expensive for the quality of the room Room needed redecoration air conditioning didn t work Table in the room was marked Just expected a bit more for the price staff helpful
 The room was really jaded and badly in need of a makeover refurb The wall paper was badly stained the furniture was all badly scratched The bed was hard and the bathroom sink area had been painted black but there were peoples names scratched in the paint Having been told this was an upgrade I dread to think what the lower grade rooms were like  Staff location and food were good
No Negative After managing to lose our car keys after a few too many cocktails the staff were so helpful and understanding The bar downstairs is beautifully situated on the river Thames and prices were incredible along with the views After originally booking the hotel for one night and ending up staying for two the rooms were perfect well equipped with a decent sized TV and comfortable bed which was perfect for cheese and biscuits after a little too much wine The room sizes are lovely and big so there s plenty of space for getting ready and spreading different outfits all over the place The hotel itself was beautiful and clean This hotel is now our first choice for everytime we come back to London Situated 5 minutes from the tube and 2 minutes away from a couple of quirky bars and a huge shopping mall Highly recommend 
 Dated room would not pay a full price We found beds to be a bit tiny and mattresses are hard for a good night sleep Old windows nose from DLR Breakfast could be better  Good locations lovely view from the window clean room good working shower Thanks to very helpful and friendly staff on 1 October 
 the onsite indian restaurant is very dated staff seem rushed off even with minimal customers Not experienced overall Food does not get delivered as per menu description dissapointing lets the overall hotel impression dowm  location comfort rooms reception staff very professional 
 The bed was hard But the worst thing was breakfast Disorganised chaos the cooked breakfast and cold items were all in the same area which meant guests were having to line up like cattle Then other guests that wanted hot water or hot milk had to ask people to move so they can get to these  Good location good parking and decent size room 
 I found the staff on the reception desk quite abrupt at times only giving the information they were asked to provide and going no further Room service didn t cope with two of our orders and a breakfast came without jam or fruit and no refund was offered Basically coffee and a croissant with five pieces of butter for 14 50 plus an extra 5 for the room service In the spa the in spa shower was burning people as the cold tap didn t work the restaurants were closing a good half hour on Friday and Saturday nights before they were advertised to take last orders This left one basic restaurant open which was not delivering 4 star food options Overall the staff seemed demoralised and unhappy and I wouldn t be surprised if there is a serious management issue underlining the problems at this hotel It should be a lovely place  The location was close to the train stations in Canary Wharf and it is easy to get around many interesting parts of London including Greenwich and Stratford It is spacious and has lots of guests It is looking a little tired decoratively but this did not detract from the lovely views 
 This hotel is completely misrepresented This hotel would be lucky to rate 2 star The room had no fridge no safe but for 5 ponds you rent a safe deposit box in the lobby which if you want to access you wait in the general queue The restaurant was closed for dinner on 3 out of 6 nights and they charge 5 pounds to deliver room service the main bar only opened at sporadic times They offered a smoking room which was not available When question about the standard of the hotel the staff responded with a take it or leave it attitude The hotel charges 85 pounds for a taxi to Heathrow while a local car company charges 45 pounds I will never book a Britannia Hotel anywhere ever again The owner must rate his own hotels because there is no way in the wide world this is a 4 star establishment No Positive
 A little big and impersonal and the breakfast was not great and I didn t like having to pay for Internet access  It was a good location for my business needs and there was a good price offer I took advantage of 
No Negative The Britannia Intl Hotel Canary Wharf is a beautiful location only one Tube stop away from the O2 Arena There are several shopping malls nearby and beautiful views of the Thames River Room prices are reasonable which is big plus for groups 
 The room was not so much clean the was problem with the shower And there was some noise in the room Breakfast had limited options  Location Great which is Canary Wharf Close to public transport and grateful view 
 Hotel staff were arguing with customers in reception and we re quite rude there was a hair in our bath and several hairs on towels when the cleaners came the next day everything was exactly the same so nothing had been cleaned  Location was excellent 5 minute walk from tube station and 1 stop from O2 arena 
 Some noise from the DLR but then that s why this location is also good  Location very convenient for conferences in facilities around Westferry Circus
 Booked a Double Room but found out when I arrived back from a late theatre show that I actually was given a twin put together and had the most uncomfy sleep in a hotel like this Hostel were more comfy explained to reception and they were not helpful or understanding and said that ALL hotels are like this I had to quickly and abruptly correct this receptionist and explained that i regularly stay overnight in hotels due to both Business and leisure purposes The Manager was kind enough to understand and offered me an option Thank you Jason train your staff in Customer Service I train professionally to most hospitality industries staffing  I loved the location and the facilities 
No Negative the room was light and airy glad i got upgraded to a room with a window though the room was clean the bed comfortable but the room was a little worn 
 There were two square covered in a tape in the ceiling one is hanging down and the other was taped I was a bit embarrassed with my 3 guest from America because of it they like the hotel but disappointed No bottle of water or sleepers Sorry The area where the hotel is located quite and easy access to train station
 No biscuits No earl grey teabags very tight with the coffee milk etc  Our bedroom was more than expected A wonderful view from our room There are 3 different restaurants So there is something for everyone 
 Long delay 1 hr for evening meal Staff were good and kept us informed why there was a delay Chef off sick and gave free starter to compensate  Room and breakfast
 Extremely poor hotel mamagement on every level Our room had no windows or air con The extractor fan was very laud and the air quality was horrible and musty Do not make the mistake at staying at this hotel Still no compensation has been given after the manager agreeing with me at the time No Positive
 Breakfast didn t offer tea cups Coffee everywhere but tea you had to make yourself in small coffee cups Breakfast assortment quite limited for a hotel of this standard No Positive
 The hotel has had plenty of money thrown at the foyer but don t let that trick you The rooms and adjoining hallways plus lifts are old antiquated and smell of stale cigarette smoke The location is not conducive to anything London has to offer except if you are going to work in canary wharfNo Positive
 There are vents which are controlled centrally and turn off at 11pm and on at 6 30am They make sleeping outside this time difficult due to the noise  Nice location Good sized room with bath Pleasant staff 
 Tired dated and not as clean as I would have liked Staff doing bear minimum no service received Basin in bathroom blocked and not draining properly didn t dare use the shower  Location availability of parking
 Very much in need of a refurb and the cooked breakfast needs to be improved as standard does not fit stars of hotel Would not pay for a night with breakfast again would go elsewhere to eat  The hotel was very tasteful and welcoming
 I d booked a room for 2 people my fellow traveller wasn t with me due to health reasons but I hadn t informed the hotel of this however once I d checked in I d found my room was actually a single bed in a tiny room which was swelteringly hot After an uncomfortable nights sleep I went down to breakfast after upgrading to include breakfast for a whopping 15 I was greeted by the most disgusting breakfast buffet I d seen It was grubby the meat was swimming in fat all of the food was tepid I could only bring myself to have a piece of toast The original victorian fixtures and amazing wooden panelling in the foyer do not make up for the appalling stay I had  Room service was good a little expensive but most stuff was 24hrs so not bad 
 The hotel is very shabby There is a new refurbished part but the room was small and basic The aircon blasted uncontrollable cold air noisily until 11pm then started again at 6am The toilet flush broke and the electric sockets weren t fixed properly to the wall  Location and price
 There s a sailing fan in the room making noise the whole night and the staff could not turn it off So I slept in a room with all the noise The room is not suitable for living yet They need to sort out the fan problems In the morning 7 30am the cleaner began to knock every door no matter u are sleeping or not It was a terrible experience living there  Great location
 Impersonal hotel for large groups Breakfast not well managed hard to find a clean table 15 min queue the second morning due I suspect to coach party with an 8am departure  Location convenient for Canary Wharf tube My room a good size and clean though colleague s was small In hotel Italian restaurant well priced and food OK if not great unlike in many London hotels 
 No bus pickup as described in tourism brochures held by the hotel Lifts slow Location poor from train especially for elderly rugby on the big TV nice room and staff
 Queues at the check in reception Breakfast was not very fresh The overall size and space throughout the hotel Location is great staff very helpful and polite
 The fact I had to pay more this time no B B deal for the price I had last time Would like advance notice of offers I like the fact I ve been here before and know what I was getting Location view is very nice 
 The parking was too expensive also there are no free parking available wifi only free for 20 mins then you have to pay after no free breakfast included in the price as it was very expensive The location was perfect to get into london easy access on the jubilie line and DLR fitness and pool was brilliant
 Unfriendly staff poor bathroom with moist stains on ceiling Apparently use of the gym and a towel was not included in the steep price I m sure this used to be a fantastic hotel a long time ago  Good location
 I am very unhappy with the stay we had here We checked in for a night s sleep and the room was right by the DLR stop so it was REALLY NOISY Nobody told us this and we only managed to sleep between 1am 5am when the DLR wasn t running My partner tried to get us moved when we checked in but they fobbed us off then I called angrily at 5am and they moved us but the new room was dirty and also noisy Awful stay I complained and got nowhere My 8am meeting was a shambles as I was so exhausted At least places like Premier Inn have the Good Night Guarantee so if you don t sleep they refund your money I asked about this and was fobbed off by the staff at the hotel Terrible place Dirty noisy rooms and rude unattentive staff  Nothing 
No Negative good size room that has everything you need we had a good deal on the room and then booked a breakfast when we arrived for 10 great will use again 
 the lifts need maintainence the windows in the bar area need refurb breakfast should be included in the price whether or which the room was exellent
 Bed was a little too firm for me REST OF ROOM GREAT no complaints  location great staff lovely rooms nice quiet despite being so central very pleasant stay and facilities 
 I had a group of business clients and their rooms were not ready although we booked the night before already so that they could be able to check in very early it was communicated to the hotel as well as the correct dates and they confirmed it by email all in order but nothing was as per the email no changes made and were advise of no shows even after the email confirmation that all is in order the clients were not happy and they were all VIP s I looked bad at the end of the day Will not use the hotel ever again unless I have no choiceNo Positive
 We ve stayed here twice now and both times the mattresses have been awful We had a twin room the first time and was hoping that the double on the second occasion would be better but sadly not It really does put me off staying here again The last time the lady checking us in was pleasant enough but the first time I found some of them quite rude to other guests Generally no one seems bothered about any one or any thing  Location is away from Central London but good for tube connection Average cost of 89 00 per night is good and if you like Indian food which I don t the restaurant on site is a bonus 
 Booking com indicated free Wifi but that is only for 20 minutes Description at Booking com should indicate this Hotel urgently needs refurbishment One light failed an shower gel became empty not observed by staff  Good location out of center but easy to reach 
 The room was absolutely freezing I was told the heating was off for the time of the year In the bathroom the hot water tap at the sink wouldn t work and I had to boil some water for a hot shave At 6 30 am I was wakened by the horrendous sound from an air vent in the ceiling I assumed it would go off after a few minutes but two and a half hours later it was still on It was so loud the tv could only be heard when the volume was at level 50 When I booked out there was no duty manager to complain to I will never return to this hotel No Positive
 Looks like it was decorated in 1984 Expensive breakfast long winded check in 0300h in the morning Messy expensive carpark no mini bar EXPENSIVE beds were OK
 It s run down needs to be totally refurbished and its dirty it s a disgrace maybe it was 4 10years ago but now it s 2 at best Booking com should not be selling it as 4 Hotel it s a disgrace to your company too if I could rate it lower I would  There is nothing about this hotel I liked
 Way too many people in the hotel lobby and 2 of the restaraunts I think they were on package tours I ate in the Indian just to get somewhere peaceful  The hotel is ideally placed for transport Because I generally work outside of London I always find Canary Wharf after dark a little magical It s a different world 
 My flight into Heathrow was late and I arrived just before midnight at the hotel having previously booked a single room through the website I hadn t had dinner and was very hungry I was told that the restaurant that was advertised to be open until 1 am had been closed down The advertisements running on the television above the reception still had it as one of it s features I asked whether I could please have a quiet room and the receptionist said I could He didn t say anything else about the room I was a bit shocked when I was given an extremely small room without a window There was an airshaft in the ceiling with a grille and I wondered what it was for At about 5 30 a m I was awoken by a very loud noise It turned out to be a blast of cold air coming through the airshaft I looked for a button in the room to see whether I could switch it off but there was none It didn t stop and it was so loud that it was impossible to go back to sleep It was unbelievable I told the reception in the morning requesting a reduction in price It was 125 pounds and I was told they could only give 10 reduction I didn t feel that this was adequate and the receptionist said there was nothing that he could do He said I should write an email to customer services I have done this but don t have a reply yet No Positive
 Very outdated and beds are very uncomfortable Tried to shorten my stay but they collected all the money upfront so I was trapped once I arrived  Good location
 The staff is poorly trained which results in slow check in Bin bag has not been replaced with baby nappy still in and the room and bed reeked of mould Elevator door can t shut properly and card key needs to be swiped at front desk every time before use  Nothing about this hotel is likeable 
 The front entrance carpets are filthy and should be replaced It is not the first time I have stayed and the staff at the front desk are miserable and stressed One was hovering and watching and interfereing with the man booking me in and it was clear animosity between them That was really not pleasant to arrive to There was no welcome at all No good evening No conversation It made me feel quite uncomfortable This needs to be addressed rapidly as this is the first impression and several times now I have had the same miserable arrival at this hotel I travel a lot and have never had it anywhere else The rooms are dated and furniture needs a good painting and lightening up  I like the privacy the convenient restaurants and the room service It could be a great place but the atmosphere is so unpleasant every time I arrive The cleaners and other staff are really good but in the front end you really need to make some changes to attitude of staff In a luxury hotel you expect politeness and a smile and welcome and some service not just a grmble and hand over your card and there s your key it really is discouraging 
 The beds were terrible and it seemed that the mattress had been there for about 10 years They were uncomfortable I had a room that had no view at all The website did say they had such rooms and I did not pick that one the staff on a face to face were not as courteous as on the phone  The food would have been ok at Ibis or a Travellodge The staff I spoke with on telephone were good and courteous 
No Negative Absolutely awful hotel Stayed here for business last week as the hilton down the road was full My double bed was two singles pushed together The noise from the train line outside meant no sleep Breakfast was a joke wasn t even shown to a table had to spend 10 mins trying to locate a free table No hot water one morning 
 We could hear all activities of all of our neighbours and the air con was noisy felt like old  The hotel looks fancy and the view from the window is amazing 
 Booked a room with a double bed and for the second time running we were given 2 single beds tied together so this would appear to be acceptable as a double bed Very uncomfortable for the cost  The location and the view
 Too expensive didn t think the customer service was very good I ordered room service twice went to order it last morning for my breakfast was 5 mins before the end of breakfast and they wouldn t deliver it I was discussed as I had paid for it not happy as we don t get a refund why have yo pay that much money for breakfast if we can t get it back if we don t have it Should be able to use it another time at least Also couldn t get WiFi up needed it for two days I was there and didn t work  The food was nice that s it Nice walk along the river Bed was comfy 
 the taps in the bathroom were falling apart the bath mat was disgusting overall the executive suite needed updating and decorating in the evening we sat in one of the bars no music and very little atmosphere No Positive
 Hotel is tired Looks exactly what it is 1980 s Breakfast process is poor Buy a ticket for 10 or add it to your bills 13 50 Restaurant staff want to clear you out the moment you arrive Breakfast is 1970 s Little Chef Hardly cutting edge capital city  Worst hotel in the best location in London 
 This hotel is completely disorganised One evening I could not even get hold of room service for in house dining even though I contacted the front desk on three occasions The hotel managed to lose my laundry although this was finally delivered albeit late I considered contacting the general manager but thought better of it as I half expected Basil Fawltey to turn up No Positive
 I booked a double bed with a window paid extra to avoid a room without window but got a twin room with no window there was a queue of around 15 20 people to checkin and the staff were very slow i had to wait more than 30 minutes staff need basic training in customer service most of them cudnt understand english and had to call thier supervisor to answer a question while i was checkin out the lady at the counter appeared very rude and she dint even bother to look at my face  The price was cheaper compared to other hotels around canary wharf
 Looks like a very old hotel not refreshed since long with quite low middle food quality and poor comfort facilities no free internet in the room thus not worth the price  Situated in Canary Wharf
 very cold and very loud 60 decibels room due to ventilation system been told they can t adjust it won t stay there again unless I can be assured I won t be in rooms without individual air con again No Positive
 Breakfast staff were unfriendly with no indication of how their system worked The only words spoken having arrived at the breakfast check in was find yourself a table The food quality was not very good The breakfast experiience was the downside of our stay  The location was very good The room had older style furnishings but very clean The airconditioning functioned very well Good friendly staff at reception 
 Far from Tube and Centrum Really old Hotel it should to be totally refurnished all is really old and overused Breakfast 13 50 pp wifi 24h 14 They ripp you really off My Room was 189 instead 440 but it worths never this amount Staff is not friendly and not helpful they wants only your money  Nothing was really good
 Furniture and decor could do with updating looking tired and even had some 3 pin plug sockets so couldn t charge my phone on the bedside table  Clean tidy nice breakfast and perfect location 2 mins walk from the tube and DLR
 It was not a bad experience but I found it difficult to understand what the staff were saying at the reception desk and I don t know whether they understood me at times Also the restaurant said they said it would be a long time before we got served at twelve thirty pm because they had a lot of orders I found this a bit strange at that time of night although the restaurant was due to close in half an hour We went to bed hungry It was not very welcoming  That the room was spotlessly clean 
 No free wifi having to buy vouchers to use internet is not great Wifi should be part of a package now staying with hotels  We were lucky to have a jucazzi in our room and great views from our balcony Would go back again to stay at hotel 
 The hotel was old worn and run down the receptionist was rude the room was tired and old the bed uncomfortable and the parking costs disgusting to park in a underground hole filled with furniture for the hotel Nothing
 No space in the car park Shower not very good difficult to get temperature right Bath towels not very big  Nice atmosphere in the bar area and close to tube train links
 aircon in the room was direct on the bed therefore useless it was impossible to regulate the hot water temperature in the bathroom hotel is quite run down reception staff was great and helpful i was upgraded to a superior room upon arrival great view of the wharf and city
 The room felt grubby so I did not unpack and the carpet felt dirty underfoot The dinning area was old and shabby and the hotel needed an overhaul The food was about average The worst was the DLS overground train service which stopped around midnight but started up again around 5am Was woken by the train each morning and waiting at night for the train to stop before sleeping Would not recommend a visit  The bedding and towels were changed everyday and the bathroom and bed were clean 
 The cleaning was not done daily and when I called in at reception to complain I was received with rude comments by the person that answered the phone The linen was not changed daily and empty bottles were not put away in the bin The restaurant was constantly closed yet it was said they open until late The door key kept not working or had some form of dysfunction to it No Positive
 I felt the bar area to be tatty and dowdy the choice of furniture needed to be uplifted and more comfortable The room was expensive and breakfast was not included although we did have to leave particularly early  The room was clean The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful 
 The staff are not well trained which made almost every interaction frustrating as many things had to be either redone or amended As a frequent traveller I would not stay here again Underground parking
 Unfortunately while booking we didn t notice that the wifi was not free of charge so bad  We took the occasion of a big discount on booking com it was worth it otherwise get prepared London isn t cheap at all The hotel is close to Canary Wharf metro station nearby there is a very nice Italian coffee shop the mozzarella bar good for breakfast if you don t have it included 
 My room had no window and no heating whatsoever But a cold air was blowing from the radiator which made the room even colder When asked the staff gave me an electric heater but it eats up the oxygen in the room and by morning I had a sore throat The breakfast was extensive though the bacon was fried to hard  room and bathroom were spotless 
 Some of the decor was a little tatty and needed upkeep Staff didn t speak clear english but were friendly  Lovely big bed nice room great view over river
 When I arrived the only rooms they offered were 1 smoking couldn t take as I have asthma or 2 room with no window I have claustrophobia so this was disastrous but had no choice Then in the morning the fire alarm went off took the fire exit route junk in all the stairwells no exit to the street came into the restaurant and lobby Finally able to ask the front desk who said the alarm was a mistake but no one went to tell the poor people standing around in their jams No Positive
 Wifi is 7 per device per day 150 for a week for my three devices I E roughly the cost of another hotel room This is crazy for a hotel that caters to businesspeople I met many others like myself working in the lobby till 2 am as a result Decor is quite odd indeed at times unsettling In house restaurant poor in quality and service  Easy transit connections roof over the head 
 All is very formal no proper place to eat as posted located in not very pleasant area with traffic not many smiles from staff as expected  Low prices
 Bed was uncomfortable room was very dated and would not say it was a 4star hotel more 3 star and that is being generous Only 20 minutes free Wi Fi and the leisure facilities were dated and needed some money spending on it not only that you also had to pay to use it  Cleaning hotel 
 Room was quite noisey Room was in need of repianting and general overhaul TV was lopsided on wall and poorly placed No selction of movies to choose from no pay as you go TV available No fridge in the room Glad the price was as stated I would have been very unhappy to have paid anymore for this type of room and the consiton it was in Very poor fruit selction at breakfast time For a 4 star hotel rating is surprising I would rate this as a 3 star hotel  Polite staff but not enough on check in check out counter Good selctionof food and drinks available on site 
 Hotel was tatty Queue for check in and check out really long and slow Restaurant service was without a smile a little slow and I was unnecessarily sat in a remote corner out of view and cramped Location
 I was extreamly unhappy with my stay at brittania Staying in a room which was dated and extremely poor standards of clenlinness Being woken up by cleaners passing by door with high pitch screeching from cleaning trolley not being able to close window as passing trams keeping me awake  Ease commute to destinations around area of London
 It was awful I ve written to the company director staff were terrible very dirty hotel air conditioning cold in room with no controls when asked about it they said nothing they could do about it room was freezing The breakfast was cold lipstick on clean teacups told staff they could care less just shrugged their shoulders then we had to find our own clean cups coffee and food was awful with funny aftertaste would never go there again I stayed in cleaner better youth hostels for 20 pounds this 192 for a night Disgusting and not happy at all has put me off using booking com also if this is the standard of hotel you are putting on your site  Leaving
 much queuing when booking in only 2 staff on during rush hour quiet effienciecy excellent breakfast and help when i husband needed it wheelchair Indian restaurant was excellent the food good compliments to the chef 
 The old paintings and decor made us feel this place was haunted Rooms are tiny and beds are not that comfy more like a spring bed spring bed than a firm Good to stay for couple hours but not over night parking is a nightmare and was an additional 20 to park with them which seemed like a set up when you have booked to stay with them Last option for us to ever book again  Dressing table opposite bed looked fine and bathroom was clean 
 The pillows had to pay for breakfast wi fi The area was perfect especially if you love the city Westminster I was showing my Grandsons around As i was born in London worked there till i had a family
 Breakfast was not the greatest buffet style basic selection ok if you were a coffee drinker pot of coffee on all the tables tea drinkers had to take there cups to the hot water urn and make there own tea bags were beside the urn to save me getting up and down as I did on my first day I made two cups at the same time I did not book breakfast with my hotel booking but on arrival was asked at reception if I would like vouchers at a reduced rate as this was a reasonable saving I got them for the duration of my stay It was the day before I left I realised that there were some places nearby that did breakfast I will know next time location once you got the lie of the land and were able to access lots of other areas easily South Quays DLR station short walk away with access to a lot of places couldn t find hotel at first as there is a lot of construction around it ok after that Swimming pool really good was able to have a swim every day that I was there 
 Very old furnhing and outdated no wifi very disappointed in the Morden world I requested for 2 single beds and was given one bed to share with a friend My request was well documented  wary of stay next time 
 Bathroom wasn t the best but did have a shower and a bath  Great room with beautiful view very comfortable Awesome location right near tube stops Lovely breakfast included too 
 The shower was broken there is no please don t disturb tag in our room and they rang twice every morning to ask cleaning yet after we leave at 2ish pm there is no longer a cleaner  Near to canary wharf easy to get the train
 Staff restaurants in the hotel were badly run we weren t allowed to use pool and leisure facilities after spending an awful lot with the company  Horrendous staff were nothing but arrogant and Did not want to help It really did ruin our holiday 
 Although described as a twin room it was two small prob 2 6 single beds pushed together Good location and clean rooms Value for money Mostly staff were helpful and friendly
 Staff attitude reception staff were very surly especially the member of staff who booked us in after asking for directions we were told just turn right no indication of where to go after turning right out of hotel but didnt persue this as the girl on the front desk the same one who booked us in made it obvious she wasn t interested no toilet roll in room apart from the last few sheets of a used roll we also asked staff in the bar if we could have extra teabags for the room and were told quite curtly go to reception seems the staff need training in customer service this didnt apply to all staff as some were very polite but the ones who were inpolite left a lasting impression of the hotel staff as a whole  Location was very good 
 My friend and I asked for a twin room we were given a Double bed that split very small I asked to have another room After explaining I was told to morrow I could request a move Much BetterTwin room Roomier why could this not have been done in the first place I also asked for a walk in shower only to be told only available in Disabled rooms I would not recommend this hotel  NOT A LOT 
 wifi not being free was a surprise compared to my previous trips when it was free 20 min first time is hardly good and surely not the right message for a business traveller proximity to business district of Canary Wharf
 We were clearly given a room for people with a disability However this meant that the sink and mirror were too low for able bodied people standing and made getting ready difficult The room was more basic than a premier inn so if you just want to put your head down and spend no time in your room it was ok for sleeping only  We could park the car in the hotel car park and the hotel was easy to find 
No Negative As always great Central to everything clean and tidy rooms Friendly helpful staff who let me check in over a hour early then I was meant to Nice bar with yummy cocktails
 The staff were like robots no expression what s so ever room was terrible could really do with a more up to date look really back dated Decore The bed was so uncomfortable didn t help my back I really wouldn t recomend this hotel to any body Ramada in the dock lands much cleaner more modem with great staff and views plus free parking  Only like the look of hotel from outside the building and my view from room 
 Noisy fan in bedroom ceiling above bed You cannot turn it off It stopped at 11 00pm and starts up at 6 30am like clockwork Breakfast not open until 7 00am You have to pay extra to use the gym I think the man said 10 50  Cleanliness location spacious entrance 
 My stay at the Britannia hotel was ridiculously horrible and I literally had to check out at like 1am cause the room smelt badly and the bed wasn t what we expected Thanks for ruining my honeymoon My stay at the Britannia hotel was ridiculously horrible and I literally had to check out at like 1am cause the room smelt badly and the bed wasn t what we expected Thanks for ruining my honeymoon
 Nothing apart from the beds being a bit narrow  We liked the view of the water and the fact that they provided tea and coffee and a kettle in the room The location was close enough to the Canary Wharf line but out of the fray of downtown 
 The staff are unfriendly unhelpful and quite surly my family stayed here 17 years ago night before my wedding and it was better then The pool sauna and steam room
 The bed was shocking A poor quality mattress that had seen better days probably in ww2 I even ended up putting the mattress on the floor to try and get better support Worst night s sleep I have ever had in any hotel Waiting to see if I get a response to the complaint I raised No Positive
 We felt the bedroom and bathroom were both good We lacked a fridge and could have done with one Suggest you provide a small fridge in each bedroom Also a safe in the cupboard for valuables  The bedroom was fine with twin beds but we would have preferred two three foot beds instead of 2 6 They were comfortable but quite narrow in this day and age 
 The water in the shower bath was lukewarm Not hot enough Air conditioner was full blast in the basement room and unable to regulate the temperature in th eroom Staff were polite
 Paid Wi Fi A hotel of this category ought to offer free unlimited Wi Fi Outside windows still need cleaning Regular free upgrades The upper floor rooms are very good very well appointed with excellent views 
 The Wifi policy was confusing inconsistent and otherwise incorrect with written and verbal communications We found a silverfish on the bed The soundproofing of the walls could here the neighbours talking and windows trains were unacceptable No Positive
 The hotel is very dated The bed was extremely small and not very well presented The frame was old and not the style expected for the type of hotel The bath shower mixer made getting the temperature right hard  The hotel was clean and in a good location easy access to tubes and buses The room itself was a nice size shower pressure very good 
 The only thing that was a problem was the length of time spent waiting for a lift The second day one was out of order The third day two were out of order The hotel has 12 floors so that could be a problem  I was nervous about staying here due to the reviews and experience in other Britannia properties but with a change in number of people going at the last minute the original hotel booked wasn t available Don t be nervous it s absolutely fine Yes it s a bit run down eg some broken tiles in one of the bedrooms but as we didn t spend the majority our time in the bathroom the bedroom or the hotel we didn t mind It didn t affect us The rooms were clean the staff were polite and friendly when we came into contact with them the beds were comfortable The area is not central but you know that when you look at the map it depends what you want to do The price for a London hotel was fairly miraculous 
 The hotel bedroom and windows are in desperate need for refurbishment as they had gaps around the window seals also the double glazing had broken down the noise of the trains only allowed us to have a maximum of about 4 5 hrs sleep during the night the noise was horrendous possible the noisiest hotel my wife and i have ever stayed at A reimbursement of costs would be a good gesture No Positive
 the beds were uncomfortable and there was a boiler fan in the room making an almighty racket It prevented me from sleeping most of the night and couldnt be turned off I wouldnt stay here again  the pricce
 I didn t like the way of treating customers especially when the manger called seeking their money for the night I was going to stay with them although I just told one of his staff that I am going to pay for that night after 30 minutes l tried to make joke with him then he said I will get you out of the hotel and that was I think very rude from him to a customer staying with them All in all he is still has to serve his customers well and politely never the less how they react  I like it s cleanses and the building is good 
 The cleaners woke us up at 07 30 even though we didn t check out till 11am Other then that nothing wrong with the hotel Great location friendly staff
 Ordered a double room but had two single beds pushed together a bit uncomfortable Room service expensive brought the wrong order and was a bit rude about it Gym staff were a bit clueless  Room was really nice staff lovely Gym and pool great Lovely location relaxed atmosphere 
 I had booked initially a single room and never seen in my whole life a 4 star hotel offering a rudimentary single bed with the room just the size of the bed that s scandalous Never thought that room that size existed in any hotel even motels are much more spacious I had to pay 20 extra per night in order to upgrade with a queen bed that s just even more scandalous Decor is dramatically old style old fashion not at all the image of brand new Canary Wharf While I travel a lot I had never seen a hotel where you would pay extra for a late check out that is just by 1 hour check out time was 11am and had to negotiate hard to allow me until 12pm as I had an important meeting in the morning before I could check out So disappointing no 4 star stance for sure and no value for money at all definitely overpriced for the basic comfort and bad service Expensive hotel rooms which are clearly overvalued and not worth the money  Onsite restaurant had affordable prices compared to the expensive hotel rooms which are clearly overvalued and not worth the money 
 Location difficulty in finding streets entrance to hotel Slightly worn in places for instance bathroom door but nothing major  Spacious room good bathroom
 As a non smoker I could smell cigarette smoke all along the corridor where my bedroom was located Breakfast was dire served by staff who were unfriendly and could not be bothered  Bar staff were very friendly 
 Room furniture old could not see television from bed or chairs you had to stand at door to see car park to hard to get in or out charged 21 stirling at breakfast still waiting for cup of tea food poorNo Positive
 Very grubby empty bottles and dirty cutlery left in corridors Lift foyers needed vacuuming Wall paper in room peeling and stained laminated wood on door flaking off Brass panels around the lift needed cleaning  Location and price 
 Terrible service I had to wait over an hour for an iron and ironing board to be delivered to my room Too few lifts I was waiting 20 minutes to get on the lift to my room The room I stayed in was in dire need of being refurbished Marks and tears across the walls One of my bathroom towels was dirty My bed sheet had stains on The windows were very small and nothing could be seen outside I was on 3rd floor  Location
 1 This is our 4th visit to the hotel and fourth room occupied so I can confirm that the so called air con is in fact either a air circulation system and not air con as advertised or it is simply broken as none of the rooms have cooled below the hotel ambient temperature which on this visit was 24 degrees  hotel was quiet at night
 i would like ask for number of room service but I asked 4 staffs which include receptionist And waiting staff nobody know the number for room service The location is brilliant which next to the river and situated in business centre 
 Rooms were in need of decorating reception staff were not helpful breakfast was poorly maintained air con didn t work window wouldn t close properly so had outside noise  The concierge was helpful and friendly Liked location 
 The breakfast was shockingly bad value for money but as there was only a subway nearby we thought it best to have breakfast in the hotel before we left on our travels Bacon and hash browns were over cooked Only coffee on the table and although the tea was unlimited I had to keep getting up to refill my tiny cup We had dinner twice in the Pizzeria during our stay and was very nice indeed Still slightly expensive but expected for London On day of checkout the maid entered our room TWICE while we were getting ready to leave Do they not receive a list of room numbers who are checking out that day No Positive
 You need to have an adapter to connect your cable to the electrical sockets because it is not on the standard and when I asked the concierge desk they said you have to pay 5 No Positive
 Didn t like the fact that I couldn t hold my deposit with a debit card but could pay for my stay with it Also the lack of hot water and pressure of the shower was terrible  I liked the location and privacy of the hotel nice to get away and not be interrupted 
 The Staff on check in were so rude Despite having stayed at the hotel previously the lady at reception even asked me if I had she was disgustingly rude to me The lift s are the slowest thing imaginable and with one out of service I waited 15 minutes for a lift I would have walked but I was on the 8th floor and my partner is recovering from knee surgery The steam room was not working but the lady in the gym again so rude insisted that we paid the 4 to use just the sauna needless to say I will never waste my money staying again Rude Staff facilities not working and the maid knocking on the door 5 times before check out time to ask if she could clean the room I have had better service in a Travelodge  The Location 
 You need to look beyond the tired decor and wonky lift It is still a great hotel and the rooms are a fabulous size for a double I have stayed in lots of London hotels and for the money trust me this is a bargain  Hotel undergoing a refurb and well worth it Once a beautiful hotel and with a facelift will be fabulous 
 The hotel is looking tired and could do with some refurbishment in places Some stair case carpets are worn and the pool spar area needs some urgent attention  Location was fantastic 
 Parts of the room were looking a bit tired Seemed to a problem with the lifts they took a long time to come  Big discount booked last minute Pleasant staff Huge room Great view from 11th floor Close to central London
 There was a bucket in the lobby to catch drips from the ceiling I was forced to pay our stay in advanced because I didn t have my credit card with me and they couldn t use the one I gave booking com for the non refundable reservation I never expected to have to pay anything after making that reservation Every morning I wasted 10m to get to the ground floor because one of the lifts wasn t working At breakfast I was handed a dirty cup and the way food was handled made me lose my appetite There were no conveniently placed power plug in the room The WiFi was ridiculously expensive  The location was convenient The view from the room was nice
 Everything else The room had not been cleaned properly after the previous guest There was urine on the toilet seat and nail clippings on the carpet Disgusting I called house keeping who did not even bother answering the phone I called the concierge who sent 2 people up They cleaned the toilet and vacuumed said sorry and left When something like that happens one wonders what else hasn t been cleaned that one doesn t know about The tap in the basin was broken On the landing at the lift there were beer bottles left out There was also a sculpture with old chewing gum stuck on it I don t know why the hotel doesn t simply increase the room rate and offer free wifi in the rooms  Proximity to airport
 Indifferent staff Obvious smell of cigarette smoke in room despite asking for non smoking room Dated decor No free wifi Cleaning staff knocked on door before 9am I d not left a do not disturb on the door but still very early to knock  Good location 
 Decor old and tired Too noisy Lifts didn t work properly which was not good when your room is on 11th Had to pay extra to use pool which had no seating area and a spa pool which didn t have proper access  Useful location for where we needed to be 
 Hotel very dated needs refurbishment Staff at reception not polite or welcoming breakfast average most food quite dry sitting for long time especially if you eat late  Location only
 stayed several times and furniture a little outdated and cleaning could be better but not awful just they could do a bit better  ease and location booking com do the real work 
 Hotel decor is a little tired settees in lounge were very worn This is a large hotel which caters for coach parties and the breakfast reflected that However it was plentiful and more than adequate if not inspired  Convenience for our chosen venue that evening
 Noisy air conditioning great views comfortable seating areas friendly staff excellent transport links would defiantly stay again choice of restaurants good breakfast
 Bathroom was dirty and mouldy beds were lumpy towels not provided properly coffee shop not open in morning no outside phone line limited and slow wifi no porter facility staff didn t smile poor sound proofing and no mini bar and more  Location
 Very tired hotel tatty furniture bath chipped noisy air con constant noise of over ground trains squeal constant noise from aircraft taking off from City Airport extra charges for swimming pool and gym Even the lifts were noisy and damaged This hotel requires a full refurbishment and consequently is no way a 4 star hotel  Location 
 Asked for a VAT receipt for the meal I had inside of the hotel promised to provide on check out But when I asked for it next day at check out they refused to provide with very bad attitude Until I started to call booking they changed their attitude and try to solve it for me Feel a bit untreated very bad experience  Location is good for communiting with Canary Wharf companies 
 The large spa bath looked tempting but it was rather worn and tired looking I m sure it was clean but it was off putting  Staff were polite Some list property was found and returned quickly The Spice Restaurant was excellent 
 Room very tired Fraying carpet Poor lighting Air con useless and stank of cigarettes Chunk of bathroom wall missing Mucky looking bath  View Layout of room Location 
 Needs a bit of repairs and update Food is pretty basic Staff were helpful We had an extra z bed put in and the first mattress was awful they replaced it no problems with a better one Place is very clean made up room daily
 The furniture in the room was old and worn down When opening a drawer the drawer front came off in my hand and the bed was squeaking every time I moved  The location is perfect for visiting Canary Warf and the staff was friendly and helpful Good value for the money 
 Only luke warm water sometimes cold Due to re furbishment which wasn t notified  Spacious room large comfortable reception area Half price compared to similar hotels the reason was re furbishment but we weren t told about this beforehand 
 dlr close to hotel so a little noisy got to hotel 2 1 2 hours earlier than official check in time and room was ready helpful lady at desk near entrance door arranged a cab for us to wedding venue and driver was very polite we had a window which we were told we wouldnt get and the view was great over the thames 
No Negative I was with my 93 year old uncle and even though we were on the 5th floor because there were three lifts we never had to wait long at all for one and they were very quick he never struggled at all I would go back again 
 The standard quality of the property shows that this hotel had its glory days many many years ago Very worn not kept up and many things did not even work properly speaker in the elevator kept repeating service service For breakfast one had a choice of buffe or buffe Could not even buy a cup of coffee it was all or nothing One friendly waiter took pity on me and gave me a whole thermos for free nice gesture The Pool Everything made from metal and painted white was rusted and looked terrible And one had to pay for the Pool visit I have never experienced that before  Perfect location 
No Negative The proximity to the underground The variety of Restaurants at the hotel Spacious rooms and good value for money and overall facilities at the hotel 
 Stayed here before but not so good this time Room was hard to find in the refurbished wing and not well signposted I am sure breakfast was included in my booking but I was charged extra  Good location handy for work
 On arrival the Chinese lady at the desk was very rude and unhelpful The room was dirty and the window sills was full of cobwebs and dead spiders flies Our room was on 12th floor and every 3 minutes could hear the tube train which sounded like thunder Windows was dirty and didn t open which didn t help with the aircon making a loud noise which is why I think they put in a small desk fan Food in the Indian restaurant was sent back and as for the breakfast well I would have taken McD Breakfast any day  Checking Out
 The bed could have been more comfortable and probably could have done with being replaced The steam room in the spa didn t work but it didn t really spoil our stay  Food in the pizzeria and spice restaurant was excellent and the service was great too Rooms were comfortable and had all the facilities that we needed and the location was excellent being right in the heart of canary wharf and close to tube and DR links Staff were friendly and helpful giving a lovely relaxed atmosphere to the hotel which was very welcome after a hard day We would definitely stay again 
 Couldn t quite understand what the staff were saying poor English Hotel does need maintaining more  I liked the fact that it s situated in a fantastic Location in the heart of canary wharf
 noisy especially DLR right outside looking dated and tired now needs a makeover like other hotels in this chain  good restaurant in house space comfortable 
 Host at check in clearly would rather have been anywhere else I asked him what time the leisure centre opened in the morning and he said he didn t know I said oh well thanks for nothing then He just shrugged  Great location and price for Canary Wharf Needs updating but it s fine for an overnight stay 
No Negative the staff were friendly and helpful and the room was great and easy to get to my concert and easy to find as it was my first time and I will definitely use it again
 hotel is very tired and hence is undergoing refurbishment however my room was hot and airconditioning didnt work i guess it was also being upgraded and windows dont open so quite an uncomfortable night on a hard bed so didnt get much sleep  Good value for money and good location
 Had to complain over ceiling leaking went to the front desk to do so but no one available at the time I was given a email address to write to so sent an email at that moment from my phone with the video attached Since I have been home I have resent the email from my pc and another email to ask why I have had no response Still waiting for response over a monthNo Positive
 Only staying one night I wished we had booked for longer  We arrived earlier than the designated check in time We were upgraded free of charge to a double suite 
 Breakfast presentation and attention to detail lacking Coffee not hot dirty cups staff should be more attentive and customer focused Black pudding made a hole in the middle still too dry hard to eat cooked food not well presented dry piled high and thrown onto serving area any old how Room Service Food tasted funny and I had a bad stomach all the time I was there Do not order food from r S Wasn t told there was a tesco nearby use this It s open till midnight Not warned about noise from train service outside Woken up very early in morning and impossible to go back to sleep with frequency of trains Not impressed at all The place looks worn and would benefit from refurbishment soundproofing also attention to detail  Good value at lower price Left my bag with the concierge free of charge whilst sightseeing Staff at reception were polite Housekeeping good room was clean Room overlooking the front road quieter Concierge very good and helpful 
 Not good for price payed noise for train not good can t sleep until they stopes running had to pay more to keep room for one hour room needs to be up dated Staff very helpfully and friendly
 Breakfast did not look very appetising and resembled what could only be described as canteen food Not overly impressed  hotel was in an ideal location and rooms were comfortable and provided everything you need Food delivered by Room service was lovely
 had to pay for the parking where most hotels if you stay you park free and the full english breakfast is very poor and the staff in the breakfast were very rude  loved the hotel
 Checking in was painfully long despite four members of staff on reception Staff were also quite unwelcoming only saying reservation And then 2 minutes of no talking followed by 10th floor lifts are behind you bye  Great view from thev10th floor and less than a 10 minute walk to Canary wharf tube station Food was nice in the pizzeria downstairs Room was slightly dated but the bathroom seemed modern and very clean 
 Room tired and dated furniture old and tatty which would have been fine had the bed not been so uncomfortable If they can t afford a refurb just change the beds Horrible smell from aircon  Location quick check in and out helpful staff clean room and bathroom Rooms had aircon 
 Booked a double got a twin no doubles left Disgustingly dirty smokey dated rooms Extremely uncomfortable bed Whole hotel stank of cigarette smoke Terrifying lifts Unfriendly unsympathetic staff Vile experience Wouldn t return if they paid me  Checking out 
 On this occasion I was give a room without a window which i did not like at all as it was very claustrophobic Previously I have had rooms with windows which were excellent It would be nice if all the external windows of the hotel could be cleaned more regularly  Good efficient service Excellent Indian restaurant in hotel Clean rooms Comfortable beds Excellent breakfast 
 The room is so old with only 3 plugs already 2 taken for tv and kettle we are in 2015 how to do with 2 phones 1 laptop and 1 tablet 1 of the restaurant is supposed to close the kitchen at 9 30pm but at 8 45 they start to tell you to eat quickly And more and more  Nothing this hotel is supposed to be a nice one It s unbelievable for the rates
 Sad we have to pay for wi fi after 20 minutes of free use  the room are huge with dressing bathtub couch the beds are ok And the location is great 5 minutes from the Canary Wharf station 
 kept up all night by a party on our floor The 13th called down to reception but nothing was done about it Had a 6am 100 mile bike ride on 20mins sleep Worst hotel sleep of my life Very unimpressed  spacious room and bathroom
 We arrived after a 5 hour drive We needed a shower but there was no hot water Enquired about this at reception and someone came to the room All the hot water had been used so unable to shower  The location was good Easy access to tube and trian
 The air con was louder than the DLR train outside The bed was very poor as you couldfeel the springs Without any prior warning the hotel decided to test the fire alarm The room was very dated The shower was very poor getting the right mix between hot and cold water was a 10minute job And the flush on the toilet was something I mastered on the final day All in all a very bad room  Nothing about the room 
 Rude staff poor internet service 145 for double room for one night The staff was acting like i was intruder t even though I was quite frequent guest When I refused to pay for my stay in advance as there was issue with internet provider they were at my room door every hour asking for money When I have told them they will get paid when the service will be restored they have said that this is the third party issue not theirs even though this service was at their premises
 Expensive breakfast twin room beds substandard Wifi charges in 2015  Staff flexibility We went for the London100 bike ride and the staff went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable and cater for our needs 
 No bad experiences but room maybe a little tired by today s standards Convenient for DLR to get into City Fair price for an on the day booking
 The lack of free WiFi in a hotel next to a business district was a disappointment The paid for service wouldn t connect for me and the 20 minute free option was unstable Some of the furniture in the room was threadbare and separating at the seams  Very convenient for business in Canary Wharf 
 Room smelled musty like someone previous had smoked in it Aircon noisy Breakfast was buffet and not very good Went to breakfast then back to room and maid was already cleaning Asked her to come back later  On site parking 21 per day 
 I can t believe there were rooms without windows Our group had 3 rooms we all paid the same but room 125 was little more than a store cupboard not acceptable for 2 people Receptionist stated we needed to request a window Pity as all other rooms were excellent Very clean and newly decorated
 Beds like concrete very cheap pillows looking very tired and somebody at max volume on his TV until 2 in the morning  Good location for the Ride London
 Elevators are old and rickety Room air conditioning was not good Wifi would not connect Bathroom tap did not shut off properly No fridge in room  Location to Canary Wharf was good Hotel was very clean Supermarket situated nearby 
 Reception staff could have been a bit more friendly not just efficient Very close to Canary Wharf restaurants Rooms were clean and well presented Parking under hotel made it convenient
 The hotel is very tired and in need of a lot of TLC In the buffet dining room sitting near the windows for the view is spoilt by the rusting shabby window frames  The staff were friendly 
 Bad parking facilities car park was full and I had a long walk to and from the West India Dock car park Heavy buzz from the air conditioning Room had no window Dated decor  Comfortable room and bed Spotlessly clean 
 bald carpet in room booked on line and asked for lowest floor room i could get and then also rang to confirm this a week or so after despite this was put on 8th floor intially when complained moved to 6th floor but person booking in in front of me was wasked if he wished the 3 4th floor when queried they did have record of my request but hadnt bothered to reserve a room for us  nice coffee at the bar
 The bathroom was tired looking and in need of a refresh but the top floor room itself was very pleasant and quaint with a spiral staircase leading to the bedroom The crowded breakfast area was a bit of a frenzy WiFi is chargeable beyond a short free period  I was upgraded so got more bang for my buck In this case the bang was a balcony with high views over Canary Wharf very nice Pleasant 5 minute walk to Canary Wharf station 
 Awful room with no window and a deafening extractor fan that could not be turned down or off and staff that apparently couldn t care less about it despite saying its a common complaint  A handy location for my purposes 
 I Had been told parking would be available but it wasn t so had to pay a lot more money to use another car park Hadn t been advised of the building work taking place effecting the parking No very early breakfast available for those taking part in cycle event despite the hotel being full of cyclists No fridges in room to keep items cold as no early breakfast available Decor in room was extremely tired and tatty in places Bath Jacuzzi didn t work  I could at least have a shower after the cycle event in the spa
 The rooms are a disgrace Need refurbishing and a good clean Nothing The staff were rude and the breakfast was awful So expensive for extremely poor value 
 Furniture was old and shabby The room was quite dusty Far too expensive for the kind of rooms given you pay a hefty price as its canary wharf  Very expensive Paid for the location rather than a decent clean room 
 The guy running the gym sauna etc was a little officious to the point of being rude  Having an Indian Restaurant in the hotel was a bonus 
 Could have free breakfast included as part of the deal Staff were friendly and helpful 
 shower was not very good decor was a bit old fashion not as elegant as the lobby room was big view was ok staff were polite lobby was beutifull
 the hotel is dated and old in need of a refurb the location
 Check out Staff very friendly room was fine Check out in the morning a little slow but that s the only thing 
 the problem was I had to pay for my parking I didn t like that but otherwise all was OK Cleanliness peaceful 
 No air con Good location
 WE WERE VERY DISATISFIED WITH THE CHAMBERMAID MOST OF EVERY ASPECT
